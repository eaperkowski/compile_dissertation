\section{Introduction}
\noindent Terrestrial biosphere models, which comprise the land surface component of Earth system models, are sensitive to the formulation of photosynthetic processes \shortcite{KnorrHeimann2001,Ziehn2011,Booth2012,Walker2021}. This is because photosynthesis is the largest carbon flux between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere \shortcite{IPCC2021}, and is constrained by ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles \shortcite{Hungate2003,LeBauer2008,Fay2015}. Many terrestrial biosphere models formulate photosynthesis by parameterizing photosynthetic capacity within plant functional groups through empirical linear relationships between area-based leaf nitrogen content ($N_\mathrm{area}$) and the maximum carboxylation rate of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ($V_\mathrm{cmax}$) \shortcite{Kattge2009,Rogers2014,Rogers2017a}. Models are also beginning to include connected carbon-nitrogen cycles \shortcite{Wieder2015_NPP,Shi2016,Davies-Barnard2020,Braghiere2022}, which allows leaf photosynthesis to be predicted directly through changes in $N_\mathrm{area}$ and indirectly through changes in soil nitrogen availability (e.g., LPJ-GUESS, CLM5.0) \shortcite{Smith2014,Lawrence2019}. Despite recent model developments, open questions remain regarding the generality of ecological relationships between soil nitrogen availability, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf photosynthesis across edaphic and climatic gradients.

Empirical support for positive relationships between soil nitrogen availability and $N_\mathrm{area}$ is abundant \shortcite{Firn2019,Liang2020}, and is a result often attributed to the high nitrogen cost of building and maintaining Rubisco \shortcite{Evans1989_photoN,EvansSeemann1989,Onoda2004,Walker2014,Onoda2017,Dong2020}. Such patterns imply that positive relationships between soil nitrogen availability and $N_\mathrm{area}$ should increase leaf photosynthesis and photosynthetic capacity by increasing the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation through increased investments to Rubisco construction and maintenance. This integrated $N_\mathrm{area}$-photosynthesis response to soil nitrogen availability has been observed both in manipulative experiments and across environmental gradients \shortcite{Field1986,Evans1989_photoN,Walker2014,Li2020}, and is thought to be driven by ecosystem nitrogen limitation, which limits primary productivity globally \shortcite{LeBauer2008,Fay2015}. However, this response is not consistently observed, as recent studies note variable $N_\mathrm{area}$-photosynthesis relationships across edaphic and climatic gradients \shortcite{Liang2020,Luo2021} and that aboveground growing conditions (e.g., light availability, temperature, vapor pressure deficit) or species identity traits (e.g., photosynthetic pathway, nitrogen acquisition strategy) may be more important for explaining variance in $N_\mathrm{area}$ and photosynthetic capacity across environmental gradients \shortcite{Adams2016,Dong2017,Smith2019,Dong2020,Peng2021,Dong2022a,Westerband2023}.

One hypothesized mechanism to explain variance in $N_\mathrm{area}$ across environmental gradients has been proposed via photosynthetic least-cost theory \shortcite{Wright2003,Prentice2014,Paillassa2020,Harrison2021}. The theory predicts that plants acclimate to environments by optimizing photosynthetic assimilation rates at the lowest summed cost of nitrogen and water use \shortcite{Wright2003,Prentice2014}. In a given environment, the theory suggests that nitrogen and water use can be substituted for each other to maintain the lowest summed cost of resource use, such that optimal photosynthetic rates are achieved with less efficient use of the more abundant and less costly resource to acquire in exchange for more efficient use of the less abundant and more costly resource to acquire.

Photosynthetic least-cost theory predicts that, all else equal, an increase in soil nitrogen availability should decrease the cost of acquiring and using nitrogen relative to water (a ratio referred to herein as $\beta$), resulting in optimal photosynthetic rates achieved with greater $N_\mathrm{area}$ at lower stomatal conductance and lower leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ \shortcite{Wright2003,Prentice2014,Paillassa2020}. Alternatively, an increase in soil moisture should reduce costs of water acquisition and use, increasing $\beta$ \shortcite{Lavergne2020}, stomatal conductance, and leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, resulting in optimal photosynthetic rates achieved with decreased $N_\mathrm{area}$. The theory also predicts variability in stomatal conductance and $N_\mathrm{area}$ in response to climatic factors, suggesting that the optimal response to increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD) should be a reduction in stomatal conductance and leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ that is counterbalanced by an increase in $N_\mathrm{area}$ to support the greater photosynthetic capacity needed to maintain high assimilation at lower conductance \shortcite{Grossiord2020,Dong2020,Lopez2021,Westerband2023}.

Leaf nitrogen allocation responses to changing climates or soil resource availability may also depend on their mode of nutrient acquisition or photosynthetic pathway. For example, species that form associations with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (referred as “N-fixing species” from this point forward) should, in theory, have access to less finite nitrogen supply than species not capable of forming such associations (referred as “non-fixing species” from this point forward), which may result in lower $\beta$ values in N-fixing species than non-fixing species. This result was previously shown in a greenhouse experiment, where a leguminous species generally had lower costs of nitrogen acquisition compared to a non-leguminous species, although these differences were generally stronger under increased nitrogen limitation \shortcite{Perkowski2021}. Lower $\beta$ values could be an explanation for why N-fixing species commonly have greater leaf nitrogen content than non-fixing species \shortcite{Adams2016,Dong2017}.

Similarly, leaf nitrogen allocation patterns across environmental gradients may be dependent on photosynthetic pathway. Lower leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ values in C$_4$ species suggests that C$_4$ species should have lower $\beta$ values than C$_3$ species \shortcite{Scott2022}, a pattern that could be the result of increased costs associated with water acquisition and use or reduced costs of nitrogen acquisition and use relative to C$_3$ species. Theory predicts that this response in C$_4$ species will cause C$_4$ species to have higher leaf nitrogen content on average compared to C$_3$ species, though ample evidence exists documenting general lower leaf nitrogen content in C$_4$ species \shortcite{Schmitt1981,Sage1987_c3c4,Ghannoum2011}. No study to date has directly quantified $\beta$ in C$_4$ species aside from the initial parameterization of $\beta$ in an optimality model for C$_4$ species \shortcite{Scott2022} using a global dataset of leaf $\delta^{13}$C values \shortcite{Cornwell2018}.

While photosynthetic least-cost theory provides a unified framework for understanding integrated effects of climate and soil resource availability on $N_\mathrm{area}$, empirical tests of the theory are sparse. Previous work shows that increasing soil nitrogen availability decreases costs of acquiring nutrients \shortcite{Bae2015,Perkowski2021,Lu2022}, which can induce predictable nutrient-water use tradeoffs expected from the theory across broad environmental gradients \shortcite{Paillassa2020,Querejeta2022,Westerband2023} and in manipulation experiments \shortcite{BialicMurphy2021}. Additionally, increasing VPD has been shown to have a positive effect on $N_\mathrm{area}$, which is commonly associated with reduced leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ \shortcite{Dong2017,Dong2020,Firn2019,Lopez2021}. 

Despite evidence for patterns expected from photosynthetic least-cost theory, studies have been restricted to exploring these patterns in C$_3$ species and, while variance in $N_\mathrm{area}$ across environmental gradients has been shown to be driven by strong negative relationships with leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ \shortcite{Dong2017,Paillassa2020,Westerband2023}, no study has explicitly investigated effects of soil resource availability or species identity on $N_\mathrm{area}$ using $\beta$ as a direct predictor of leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. Furthermore, as $N_\mathrm{area}$ can be broken down into structural (leaf mass per area; $M_\mathrm{area}$; g m$^{-2}$) and metabolic (mass-based leaf nitrogen content; $N_\mathrm{mass}$; gN g$^{-1}$) components \shortcite{Dong2017}, no study has investigated which component of $N_\mathrm{area}$ drives the hypothesized response of $N_\mathrm{area}$ to leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. Understanding whether changes in $N_\mathrm{area}$ due to leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ are driven by changes in leaf morphology (i.e. $M_\mathrm{area}$), stoichiometry (i.e. $N_\mathrm{mass}$), or both, is important, particularly because $N_\mathrm{mass}$ may negatively covary with $M_\mathrm{area}$ across environmental gradients due to tradeoffs between leaf longevity and leaf productivity \shortcite{Wright2004,Reich2014,Onoda2017,Wang2023}.

In this study, I measured $N_\mathrm{area}$, $N_\mathrm{mass}$, $M_\mathrm{area}$, leaf $\delta^{13}$C-derived estimates of leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, and leaf $\delta^{13}$C-derived estimates of $\beta$ in 520 individuals spanning 57 species scattered across 24 grassland sites in Texas, USA. Texas contains a diverse climatic gradient, indicated by 2006-2020 mean annual precipitation totals ranging from 204 to 1803 mm and 2006-2020 mean annual temperature ranging from 11.8\textdegree{} to 24.6\textdegree{}C. Variability in soil nitrogen availability and soil moisture was expected across sites, owing to differences in soil texture and aboveground climate that would drive differential rates of water retention and nitrogen transformations to plant-available nitrogen substrate. I leveraged the expected climatic and soil resource variability across sites to test the following hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Soil nitrogen availability will decrease $\beta$ through a reduction in costs of nitrogen acquisition and use, while soil moisture will increase $\beta$ through a reduction in costs of water acquisition and use. Following previous results, I expected that N-fixing species would have lower $\beta$ values and that C$_4$ species would have lower $\beta$ values.
    
    \item Leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ will be positively related to $\beta$, a pattern that will result in a negative indirect effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, a positive indirect effect of increasing soil moisture on leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, and lower leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ in both N-fixing species and C$_4$ species. I expected that leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ would be negatively related to VPD, as increasing atmospheric dryness would cause plants to close stomata to minimize water loss.

    \item $N_\mathrm{area}$ will be negatively related to leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. This response will result in an indirect positive and negative effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability and soil moisture, respectively, on $N_\mathrm{area}$, and larger $N_\mathrm{area}$ values in N-fixing species. While theory predicts that lower $\beta$ values in C$_4$ species should yield larger $N_\mathrm{area}$ in C$_4$ species, I expected that C$_4$ species would have lower $N_\mathrm{area}$ than $C_3$ species due to greater nitrogen use efficiency in C$_4$ species. Additionally, I expected VPD to increase $N_\mathrm{area}$, a pattern that would be directly mediated through the reduction in leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ with increasing VPD.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{\textit{Site descriptions and sampling methodology}}
\noindent I collected leaf and soil samples from 24 open canopy grassland sites scattered across central and eastern Texas in summer 2020 and summer 2021 (Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.1}). Twelve sites were visited between June and July 2020 and 14 sites (11 unique from 2020) were visited between May and June 2021 (Table \ref{tab:table4.1}). I explicitly chose sites that maximized variability in precipitation and edaphic variability between sites while minimizing temperature variability across the environmental gradient (Table \ref{tab:table4.1}). No site with personally communicated or anecdotal evidence of grazing or disturbance (e.g., mowing, feral hog activity, etc.) was used. I collected leaf material from three individuals each of the five most abundant species at random locations at each site, only  selecting species that were broadly classified as graminoid or forb/herb growth habits per the USDA PLANTS database \shortcite{USDANRCS2022}. All collected leaves were fully expanded with no visible herbivory or other external damage and also free from shading by nearby shrubs or trees. Five soil samples were collected from 0-15 cm below the soil surface at each site near the leaf collection sample locations. Soil samples were mixed together by hand to create one composite soil sample per site.

\subsection{\textit{Leaf trait measurements}}
\noindent Images of each leaf were taken immediately following each site visit using a flat-bed scanner. Fresh leaf area was determined from each image using the `LeafArea' R package \shortcite{Katabuchi2015}, which automates leaf area calculations using ImageJ software \shortcite{Schneider2012}. Each leaf was dried at 65\textdegree{}C for at least 48 hours to a constant mass, weighed, and manually ground in a mortar and pestle until homogenized. Leaf mass per area ($M_\mathrm{area}$; g m$^{-2}$) was calculated as the ratio of dry leaf biomass to fresh leaf area. Subsamples of dried and homogenized leaf tissue were used to measure leaf nitrogen content ($N_\mathrm{mass}$; gN g$^{-1}$) through elemental combustion analysis (Costech-4010, Costech Instruments, Valencia, CA). Leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area ($N_\mathrm{area}$; gN m$^{-2}$) was calculated as the product of $N_\mathrm{mass}$ and $M_\mathrm{area}$.
    
Subsamples of dried and homogenized leaf tissue were sent to the University of California-Davis Stable Isotope Facility to determine leaf $\delta^{13}$C. Leaf $\delta^{13}$C values were determined using an elemental analyzer (PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL; Sercon Ltd., Chestshire, UK) interfaced to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (PDZ Europa 20-20 Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, Sercon Ltd., Chestshire, UK). I used leaf $\delta^{13}$C values (‰; relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite international reference standard) to estimate the ratio of intercellular ($C_\mathrm{i}$) to extracellular ($C_\mathrm{a}$) CO$_2$ ratio (leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$; unitless) following the approach of \shortciteN{Farquhar1989} described in \shortciteN{Cernusak2013}. Specifically, I derived leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ as:

\begin{equation} 
    \label{eq_4.1}
    C_i:C_a = \frac{\Delta^{13}C - a}{b - a}
\end{equation}
    
\noindent where $\Delta^{13}$C represents the relative difference between leaf $\delta^{13}$C (‰) and air $\delta^{13}$C (‰), calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq_4.2}
    \Delta^{13}C = \frac{\delta^{13}C_{air} - \delta^{13}C_{leaf}}{1 + \delta^{13}C_{leaf}}
\end{equation}

\noindent $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C_{air}}$, which is commonly assumed to be -8‰ \shortcite{Keeling1979,Farquhar1989}, was calculated as a function of calendar year \textit{t} using an empirical equation derived in \shortciteN{Feng1999}:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq_4.3}
    \delta^{13}C_{air} = -6.429 - 0.006e^{0.0217(t-1740)}
\end{equation}
    
 \noindent Using this equation, $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C_{air}}$ values were set to -9.04‰ and -9.09‰ for 2020 and 2021, respectively. The parameter \textit{a} represents the fractionation between $^{12}$C and $^{13}$C due to diffusion in air, assumed to be 4.4‰, while \textit{b} represents the fractionation caused by Rubisco carboxylation, assumed to be 27‰ \shortcite{Farquhar1989}. For C$_4$ species, \textit{b} in Eqn. \ref{eq_4.1} was set to 6.3‰, and was derived from:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq_4.4}
    b = c + (d \cdot \phi)
\end{equation}
    
\noindent Where \textit{c} was set to -5.7‰ and \textit{d} was set to 30‰ \shortcite{Farquhar1989}. $\phi$, which is the bundle sheath leakiness term, was set to 0.4. All leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ values less than 0.1 and greater than 0.95 were assumed to be incorrect and removed from the analysis.
    
I derived the unit cost of resource use ($\beta$) using leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and site climate data using equations first described in \shortciteN{Prentice2014} and simplified in \shortciteN{Lavergne2020}:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq_4.5}
    \beta = 1.6\eta^{*} VPD \frac{\chi - (\frac{\Gamma^*}{C_{a}})^{2}}{(1 - \chi)^{2}(K_{m} + \Gamma^{*})}
\end{equation}
    
\noindent where $\eta^{*}$ is the viscosity of water relative to 25\textdegree{}C, calculated using elevation and mean air temperature of the seven days leading up to each site visit following equations in \shortciteN{Huber2009}. VPD (Pa) was set to the mean vapor pressure deficit of the seven days leading up to each site visit, $C_\mathrm{a}$ represents atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration, arbitrarily set to 420 $\mathrm{\mu mol\ mol^{-1}}$ CO$_2$. $K_\mathrm{m}$ (Pa) is the Michaelis-Menten coefficient for Rubisco affinity to CO$_2$ and O$_2$, calculated as:
    
\begin{equation} \label{eq_4.6}
    K_{m} = K_{c} \cdot \left ( 1 + \frac{O_i}{K_o} \right )
\end{equation}

\noindent where $K_\mathrm{c}$ (Pa) and $K_\mathrm{o}$ (Pa) are the Michaelis-Menten coefficients for Rubisco affinity to CO$_2$ and O$_2$, respectively, and $O_\mathrm{i}$  is the intercellular O$_2$ concentration. $\Gamma^{*}$ (Pa) is the CO$_2$ compensation point in the absence of dark respiration. $K_\mathrm{c}$, $K_\mathrm{o}$, and $\Gamma^{*}$ were determined using equations described in \shortciteN{Medlyn2002} and derived in \shortciteN{Bernacchi2001}, invoking an elevation correction for atmospheric pressure as explained in \shortciteN{Stocker2020}.

\subsection{\textit{Site climate data}}
\noindent I used the Parameter elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) \shortcite{Daly2008} climate product to access gridded daily temperature and precipitation data for the coterminous United States at a 4-km grid resolution between January 1, 2006 and July 31, 2021 (PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University, \url{https://prism.oregonstate.edu}, data created 4 Feb 2014, accessed 24 Mar 2022). Mean daily air temperature, mean daily VPD, and total daily precipitation data were extracted from the grid cell that contained the latitude and longitude of each property using the `extract’ function in the `terra’ R package \shortcite{Hijmans2022}. PRISM data were used in lieu of local weather station data because several rural sites did not have a local weather station present within a 20-km radius of the site. Daily site climate data were used to estimate mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature for each site between 2006 and 2020 (Table \ref{tab:table4.1}). I calculated total precipitation and mean daily VPD for the prior 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, and 90 days leading up to each site visit. Temperature was not included in any analysis due to the close range in mean annual temperature between sites (mean$\pm$SD: 19.8$\pm$0.9\textdegree{}C; Table \ref{tab:table4.1}).

\subsection{\textit{Site edaphic characteristics}}
\noindent Composited soil samples were sent to the Texas A\&M Soil, Water and Forage Laboratory to quantify soil nitrate concentration (NO$_3$-N; ppm). Soil NO$_3$-N was determined by extracting composite soil samples in 1 M KCl, measuring absorbance values of extracts at 520 nm using the end product of a NO$_3$-N to NO$_2$-N cadmium reduction reaction \shortcite{Kachurina2000,Keeney1983}. Soil texture data from 0-15 cm below the soil surface were accessed using the SoilGrids2.0 data product \shortcite{Poggio2021} through the `fetchSoilGrids’ function in the ‘soilDB’ R package \shortcite{Beaudette2022}. I used SoilGrids2.0 to access soil texture data in lieu of analyses using the composite soil sample due to a lack of soil material from some sites after sending samples for soil NO$_3$-N.

Soil moisture was not measured in the field, but was estimated using the `Simple Process-Led Algorithms for Simulating Habitats’ model (SPLASH) \shortcite{Davis2017}. This model, derived from the STASH model \shortcite{Cramer1988}, spins up a bucket model using Priestley-Taylor equations \shortcite{Priestley1972} to calculate daily soil moisture ($W_\mathrm{n}$; mm) as a function of the previous day’s soil moisture ($W_\mathrm{n}{}_{-1}$; mm), daily precipitation ($P_\mathrm{n}$; mm), condensation ($C_\mathrm{n}$; mm), actual evapotranspiration ($E_{n}^a$; mm), and runoff (RO; mm):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq_4.7}
    W_n = W_{n-1} + P_n + C_n - E_{n}^{a} - RO
\end{equation}

\noindent Models were spun up by equilibrating the previous day's soil moisture using successive model iterations with daily mean air temperature, daily precipitation total, the number of daily sunlight hours, and latitude as model inputs \shortcite{Davis2017}. Daily sunlight hours were estimated for each day at each site using the `getSunlightTimes’ function in the `suncalc’ R package, which estimated sunrise and sunset times of each property using date and site coordinates \shortcite{Thieurmel2019}. Water holding capacity (mm), or bucket size, was estimated as a function of soil texture using pedotransfer equations explained in \shortciteN{Saxton2006}, as done in \shortciteN{Stocker2020} and \shortciteN{Bloomfield2022}. A summary of these equations is included in \hyperref[appendix.c1]{Appendix C.1}.

Daily soil moisture outputs from the SPLASH model for each site were used to calculate mean daily soil moisture for the prior 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, and 90 days leading up to each site visit. Mean daily soil moisture values were then expressed as a fraction of water holding capacity to normalize across sites with different bucket depths, as done in \shortciteN{Stocker2018}. Site water holding capacity values are referenced in Table \ref{tab:table4.1}.

\subsection{\textit{Plant functional group assignments}}
\noindent Plant functional group was assigned to each species and used as the primary descriptor of species identity. Specifically, plant functional groups were assigned based on photosynthetic pathway (C$_3$, C$_4$) and ability to form associations with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (legume, nonlegume). The ability to form associations with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria was assigned based on whether species were in the \textit{Fabaceae} family, and photosynthetic pathway of each species was determined from past literature and confirmed through leaf $\delta^{13}$C values. I chose these plant functional groups based on \textit{a priori} hypotheses regarding the functional role of nitrogen fixation and photosynthetic pathway on the sensitivity of plant nitrogen uptake and leaf nitrogen allocation to soil nitrogen availability and aboveground growing conditions. These plant functional group classifications resulted in three distinct plant functional groups within our dataset: C$_3$ legumes (n=53), C$_3$ nonlegumes (n=350), and C$_4$ nonlegumes (n=117).

\subsection{\textit{Data analysis}}
\noindent All analyses and plotting were conducted in R version 4.1.1 \shortcite{RCoreTeam2021}. I constructed a series of separate linear mixed-effects models to investigate environmental drivers of $\beta$, leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, $N_\mathrm{area}$, $N_\mathrm{mass}$, and $M_\mathrm{area}$, followed by a path analysis using a piecewise structural equation model to investigate direct and indirect effects of climate and soil resource availability on $N_\mathrm{area}$.

To explore environmental drivers of $\beta$, I built a linear mixed-effects model that included soil moisture, soil nitrogen availability, and plant functional group as fixed effect coefficients. Species were designated as a random intercept term. Interaction coefficients between all possible combinations of the three fixed effect coefficients were also included. $\beta$ was natural log transformed to linearize data. I used an information-theoretic model selection approach to determine whether 90-, 60-, 30-, 20-, 15-, 10-, 9-, 8-, 7-, 6-, 5-, 4-, 3-, 2-, or 1-day mean daily soil moisture conferred the best model fit for $\beta$. To do this, I constructed 16 separate linear mixed-effects models where log-transformed $\beta$ was included as the response variable and each soil moisture time step was separately included as a single continuous fixed effect. Species were included as a random intercept term for all models. I used corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) to select the soil moisture timescale that conferred the best model fit, indicated by the model with the lowest AICc score (Table \ref{tab:tab.c4}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure.c1}).

To explore environmental drivers of leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, I constructed a second linear mixed effects model that included VPD, soil moisture, soil nitrogen availability, and plant functional group as fixed effect coefficients. Two-way interactions between plant functional group and VPD, soil nitrogen availability, or soil moisture were included as additional fixed effect coefficients, in addition to a three-way interaction between soil moisture, soil nitrogen availability, and plant functional group. Species were included as a random intercept term. I used an information-theoretic model selection approach to determine whether 90-, 60-, 30-, 20-, 15-, 10-, 9-, 8-, 7-, 6-, 5-, 4-, 3-, 2-, or 1-day mean daily VPD conferred the best model fit for leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ using the same approach explained above for the soil moisture effect on $\beta$. The soil moisture timescale was set to the same timescale that conferred the best fit for $\beta$.

To explore environmental drivers of $N_\mathrm{area}$, $N_\mathrm{mass}$, and $M_\mathrm{area}$, I constructed a linear mixed effects model for each trait, including leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, soil nitrogen availability, soil moisture, and plant functional group as fixed effect coefficients for each model. Two-way interactions between plant functional group and $\beta$, leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, soil nitrogen availability, or soil moisture were included as additional fixed effect coefficients, in addition to a three-way interaction between soil nitrogen availability, soil moisture, and plant functional group. Species were included as a random intercept term, with the soil moisture timescale set to the same timescale that conferred the best fit for $\beta$.

In all linear mixed-effects models explained above, including those to select relevant timescales, I used the `lmer' function in the `lme4' R package \shortcite{Bates2015} to fit each model and the `Anova' function in the `car' R package \shortcite{Fox2019} to calculate Type II Wald's $\chi^2$ and determine the significance level ($\alpha$=0.05) of each fixed effect coefficient. I used the `emmeans' R package \shortcite{Lenth2019} to conduct post-hoc comparisons using Tukey's tests, where degrees of freedom were approximated using the Kenward-Roger approach \shortcite{Kenward1997}. Trendlines and error ribbons for all plots were drawn using a series of `emmeans’ outputs across the range in plotted x-axis values.

Finally, I conducted a path analysis using a piecewise structural equation model to examine direct and indirect pathways that determined variance in $N_\mathrm{area}$. Six separate linear mixed effects models were loaded into the piecewise structural equation model. Models were constructed per \textit{a priori} hypotheses following patterns expected from photosynthetic least-cost theory. The first model regressed $N_\mathrm{area}$ against $N_\mathrm{mass}$ and $M_\mathrm{area}$. The second model regressed $M_\mathrm{area}$ against leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. The third model regressed $N_\mathrm{mass}$ against leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and $M_\mathrm{area}$ \shortcite{Dong2017,Dong2020}. The fourth model regressed leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ against $\beta$ and VPD. The fifth model regressed $\beta$ against soil nitrogen availability, soil moisture, ability to associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and photosynthetic pathway. The sixth model regressed soil nitrogen availability against soil moisture. All models included the relevant timescale selected in the individual linear mixed effect models explained above. Models included species as a random intercept term, were built using the `lme’ function in the `nlme’ R package \shortcite{Pinheiro2022}, and subsequently loaded into the piecewise structural equation model using the `psem’ function in the `piecewiseSEM’ R package \shortcite{Lefcheck2016}.

\section{Results}
\subsection{\textit{Cost to acquire nitrogen relative to water}}
\noindent Model selection indicated that 90-day mean soil moisture conferred the best model fit for $\beta$ (AICc=1429.14; Table \ref{tab:tab.c4}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure.c1}).

Increasing soil nitrogen availability generally decreased $\beta$  (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.2}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.2}a), a pattern driven by a negative effect of increasing soil nitrogen on $\beta$  in C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.002) and C$_3$ legumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.031) despite a null effect of soil nitrogen on $\beta$ in C$_4$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.905). There was no effect of soil moisture on $\beta$  (\textit{p}=0.902; Table \ref{tab:table4.2}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.2}b). A functional group effect (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.2}) indicated that C$_4$ nonlegumes generally had lower $\beta$ values than both C$_3$ legumes and C$_3$ non-legumes (Tukey: \textit{p}<0.001 in both cases), while $\beta$ values in C$_3$ legumes did not differ from C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.804).

\subsection{\textit{Leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$}}
\noindent Model selection indicated that 4-day mean VPD was the timescale that conferred the best model fit for leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ (AICc=-793.49; Table \ref{tab:tab.c4}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure.c1}).

Model results revealed that increasing VPD generally decreased leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.3}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.3}a). There was no effect of soil moisture (\textit{p}=0.843; Table \ref{tab:table4.3}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.3}b) or soil nitrogen availability (\textit{p}=0.544; Table \ref{tab:table4.3}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.3}c) on leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. A strong plant functional group effect (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.3}) indicated that C$_4$ nonlegumes had lower leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ than C$_3$ legumes and C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}<0.001 in both cases), with no difference between C$_3$ legumes and C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.865).

\subsection{\textit{Leaf nitrogen content}}
\noindent An interaction between leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and plant functional group (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}) revealed that the negative effect of increasing leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{area}$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}) was driven by a negative effect of increasing leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{area}$ in C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}<0.001) and C$_3$ legumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.002), but not C$_4$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.795; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.4}a). An interaction between soil nitrogen availability and plant functional group (\textit{p}=0.041; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}) indicated that the positive effect of increasing soil nitrogen (\textit{p}=0.007; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}) was only apparent in C$_3$ legumes (Tukey: \textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.4}d), but not C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.449) or C$_4$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.680). Increasing soil moisture increased $N_\mathrm{area}$ (\textit{p}=0.010, Table \ref{tab:table4.4}). A plant functional group effect (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}) indicated that C$_4$ nonlegumes had lower $N_\mathrm{area}$ compared to C$_3$ legumes (Tukey: \textit{p}<0.001) and C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}<0.001), while C$_3$ legumes had lower $N_\mathrm{area}$ compared to C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.030).

A marginal interaction between soil nitrogen availability and soil moisture (\textit{p}=0.097; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}) indicated that the positive effect of increasing soil nitrogen on $N_\mathrm{mass}$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.4}e) was only apparent when soil moisture was less than 50\% of the maximum water holding capacity (Tukey: \textit{p}<0.05 in all cases). There was no effect of leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{mass}$ (\textit{p}=0.447; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.4}b). Increasing soil moisture had a positive effect on $N_\mathrm{mass}$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.4}h). A plant functional group effect (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}) indicated that C$_4$ nonlegumes had lower $N_\mathrm{mass}$ compared to C$_3$ legumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.003) and C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.011), while $N_\mathrm{mass}$ did not differ between C$_3$ legumes and C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.231).

Variance in $M_\mathrm{area}$ was driven by a three-way interaction between soil nitrogen availability, soil moisture, and plant functional group (\textit{p}=0.018; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}). This interaction indicated that increasing soil moisture increased the positive effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $M_\mathrm{area}$ in C$_3$ legumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.030) but did not modify the negative effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $M_\mathrm{area}$ in C$_4$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.511) or C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}>0.999). There was otherwise no effect of soil moisture on $M_\mathrm{area}$ (\textit{p}=0.696; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}), but there was a general negative effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $M_\mathrm{area}$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}). An interaction between leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and plant functional group (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.4}c) indicated that negative effect of increasing leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $M_\mathrm{area}$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.4}) was driven by a negative effect of increasing leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $M_\mathrm{area}$ in C$_3$ legumes and C$_3$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}<0.001 in both cases), but not C$_4$ nonlegumes (Tukey: \textit{p}=0.343; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.4}c).

\subsection{\textit{Structural equation model}}
\noindent The piecewise structural equation model explained 89\%, 56\%, 77\%, 82\%, and 37\% of variance in $N_\mathrm{area}$, $N_\mathrm{mass}$, $M_\mathrm{area}$, leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, and $\beta$, respectively (Table \ref{tab:table4.5}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.5}). Variance in $N_\mathrm{area}$ was driven by a positive effect of increasing $N_\mathrm{mass}$ and $M_\mathrm{area}$ (\textit{p}<0.001 in both cases; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.5}). Model results indicated that an indirect negative effect of $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{area}$ was driven by a strong reduction in $M_\mathrm{area}$ with increasing leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}) paired with no effect of increasing $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{mass}$ (\textit{p}=0.111; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}). However, there was a strong negative effect of increasing $M_\mathrm{area}$ on $N_\mathrm{mass}$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.5}). Leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ increased with increasing $\beta$ (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}) and decreased with increasing VPD (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.5}). Variance in $\beta$ was driven by a negative effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}) and was generally higher in C$_3$ species (\textit{p}<0.001; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.5}). However, $\beta$ did not change with soil moisture (\textit{p}=0.904; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}) or with ability to acquire nitrogen via symbiotic nitrogen fixation (\textit{p}=0.495; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}). Finally, soil nitrogen availability was positively associated with increasing soil moisture (\textit{p}=0.002; Table \ref{tab:table4.5}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure4.5}).

\section{Discussion}
\noindent In this study, I quantified direct and indirect effects of edaphic and climatic characteristics on $N_\mathrm{area}$ and components of $N_\mathrm{area}$ ($N_\mathrm{mass}$ and $M_\mathrm{area}$) in 520 individuals spanning across a soil resource availability and climate gradient in Texas, USA. Strong and consistent patterns emerged in support of those expected from photosynthetic least-cost theory, a result driven by a strong direct negative relationship between leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and $N_\mathrm{area}$. In further support of patterns expected from theory, increasing soil nitrogen availability had a strong negative effect on $\beta$, resulting in an indirect stimulation in $N_\mathrm{area}$ mediated through a positive relationship between $\beta$ and $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. Increasing VPD also indirectly increased $N_\mathrm{area}$ through a direct negative effect of increasing VPD on leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, following hypotheses and patterns expected from theory. Interestingly, a strong positive association between soil moisture and $N_\mathrm{area}$ was driven by covariance between soil moisture and soil nitrogen availability and was not associated with a direct effect of soil moisture on $\beta$. Overall, results provide strong and consistent support for patterns expected from photosynthetic least-cost theory, showing that both soil resource availability and climate drive variance in $N_\mathrm{area}$ through changes in leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$.

\subsection{\textit{Negative effects of leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{area}$ are driven by reductions in $M_\mathrm{area}$, not $N_\mathrm{mass}$}}
\end{singlespace}
\noindent A strong negative effect of increasing leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{area}$ was detected in both the linear mixed effect and piecewise structural equation models. The negative response of $N_\mathrm{area}$ to increasing leaf $C_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{:}C_\mathrm{a}$ is consistent with previous environmental gradient \shortcite{Dong2017,Querejeta2022} and manipulation experiments (\ref{fig:figure3.4}c), showing strong support for the nitrogen-water use tradeoffs expected from photosynthetic least cost theory \shortcite{Wright2003,Prentice2014}. Negative effects of increasing leaf $C_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{:}C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{area}$ were driven by a strong negative effect of increasing $C_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{:}C_\mathrm{a}$ on $M_\mathrm{area}$, with no apparent effect of leaf $C_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{:}C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{mass}$, suggesting that changes in $N_\mathrm{area}$ were driven by changes in leaf structure and not leaf chemistry. However, increasing $M_\mathrm{area}$ was negatively associated with $N_\mathrm{mass}$, indicating that an increase in $N_\mathrm{mass}$ was associated with larger, thinner leaves (i.e. lower $M_\mathrm{area}$). These results are consistent with patterns reported from previous studies indicating that variance in $N_\mathrm{area}$ is driven by changes in $M_\mathrm{area}$ across environmental gradients, and that part of this response is due to negative covariance between $M_\mathrm{area}$ and $N_\mathrm{mass}$ \shortcite{Dong2017,Dong2020}. Negative covariance between $M_\mathrm{area}$ and $N_\mathrm{mass}$ could be a response associated with tradeoffs between leaf longevity and leaf productivity \shortcite{Wright2004,Dong2017,Dong2022a,Querejeta2022,Wang2023}.

The negative relationship between leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and $M_\mathrm{area}$ could also be a response that allows leaves to maximize productivity in shorter-lived leaves. Tradeoffs between leaf longevity and leaf productivity are commonly observed and are included in a continuum of coordinated leaf traits that position individuals along a fast- or slow-growing leaf economics spectrum \shortcite{Wright2003,Onoda2004,Reich2014,Onoda2017,Wang2023}. Negative relationships between leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and $M_\mathrm{area}$ indicate that increased stomatal conductance and reduced water use efficiency were associated with thinner, larger leaves (i.e., lower $M_\mathrm{area}$). These patterns, combined with the negative covariance between $M_\mathrm{area}$ and $N_\mathrm{mass}$ mentioned above, may have allowed individuals to maximize light interception and productivity by exploiting high light environments, though this comes at the expense of increased water loss and decreased water-use efficiency. This strategy may be especially advantageous for fast-growing species in open canopy systems. In this study, C$_3$ legumes and C$_3$ nonlegumes dominated the dataset (78\% of total sampling effort), of which 22\% (17\% of total sampling effort) were classified as annual species with short growing seasons. We observed no effect of leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{area}$ or $M_\mathrm{area}$ in C$_4$ nonlegumes, which made up 22\% of the sampling effort and were generally classified as warm season graminoid species with slower growth rates and longer growing seasons. These patterns indicate that stronger tradeoffs between nitrogen and water use may be more apparent in fast-growing species with high demand for building and maintaining productive leaf tissues.

\subsection{\textit{Soil nitrogen availability increases $N_\mathrm{area}$ through changes in $\beta$}}
\end{singlespace}
\noindent The experimental and statistical approach used in this study allowed for $N_\mathrm{area}$ and components of $N_\mathrm{area}$ to be quantified as direct and indirect products of soil nitrogen availability. Linear mixed effect models revealed a positive effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $N_\mathrm{area}$, a pattern that was driven by a stronger positive effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $N_\mathrm{mass}$ than the negative effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $M_\mathrm{area}$. These patterns were associated with a reduction in $\beta$ with increasing soil nitrogen availability. Similar patterns were observed in the structural equation model, where indirect positive effects of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $N_\mathrm{area}$ were driven by negative effects of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $\beta$, positive relationships between $\beta$ and leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, and negative relationships between leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and $M_\mathrm{area}$. However, structural equation model results revealed a null direct relationship between leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and $N_\mathrm{mass}$, and instead indicated an indirect positive effect of leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ on $N_\mathrm{mass}$ mediated through strong negative covariance between $M_\mathrm{area}$ and $N_\mathrm{mass}$.

Results reported here suggest that positive direct effects of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $N_\mathrm{area}$ are not necessarily the direct product of increased leaf nitrogen concentration, as has been previously suggested \shortcite{Firn2019,Liang2020}. Instead, effects of increasing soil nitrogen availability on leaf nitrogen concentration may be driven by costs of nitrogen acquisition relative to water and negative covariance between $M_\mathrm{area}$ and $N_\mathrm{mass}$, following patterns predicted by photosynthetic least-cost theory. Findings reported here suggest that studies quantifying variance in leaf nitrogen content across resource availability gradients may risk confounding covariance between $M_\mathrm{area}$ and $N_\mathrm{mass}$ if costs of nitrogen acquisition relative to water are not also quantified.

\subsection{\textit{Soil moisture increases $N_\mathrm{area}$ by facilitating increases in soil nitrogen availability}}
\end{singlespace}
\noindent Increasing soil moisture had a positive effect on $N_\mathrm{area}$, a response that was associated with a null effect of soil moisture on $\beta$. These results contrast patterns expected from theory, where increasing soil moisture is expected to indirectly decrease $N_\mathrm{area}$ through an increase in $\beta$ due to a reduction in costs associated with water acquisition and use \shortcite{Wright2003,Prentice2014,Lavergne2020}. Interestingly, structural equation model results revealed a strong positive association between soil moisture and soil nitrogen availability, indicating an indirect positive effect of increasing soil moisture on $N_\mathrm{area}$ mediated by the negative effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $\beta$. In Texan grasslands, productivity and nutrient uptake are often co-limited by precipitation and nutrient availability \shortcite{Yahdjian2011,Wang2017_NPP_stability}. Thus, increases in soil moisture may have facilitated more favorable and productive environments for soil microbial communities \shortcite{Reichman1966,Stark1995,Paul2003}, or alternatively greater nitrogen mobility in soil solution. As discussed above, the positive indirect response of $N_\mathrm{area}$ to increasing soil nitrogen availability as mediated through reductions in $\beta$ follow patterns expected from theory.

\begin{singlespace}
\subsection{\textit{Indirect effects of climate on $N_\mathrm{area}$ are mediated through changes in leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and $\beta$}}
\end{singlespace}
\noindent In support of hypotheses and patterns expected from theory, increasing vapor pressure deficit indirectly increased $N_\mathrm{area}$, mediated through the negative effect of increasing vapor pressure deficit on leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. These responses are consistent with previous work noting strong reductions in stomatal conductance with increasing vapor pressure deficit \shortcite{Oren1999,Novick2016,Sulman2016,Grossiord2020,Lopez2021}, a response that allows plants to minimize water loss as a result of high atmospheric water demand. Results also support findings from previous experiments across environmental gradients, where increasing vapor pressure deficit generally increases $N_\mathrm{area}$ at lower stomatal conductance across environmental gradients \shortcite{Dong2017,Dong2022a,Paillassa2020,Westerband2023}. These responses provide another line of evidence that suggests leaf nitrogen content is a deterministic acclimation response to changing aboveground climate, allowing plants to satisfy demand to build and maintain photosynthetic enzymes and optimize photosynthetic processes by maximizing resource use efficiency \shortcite{Paillassa2020,Peng2021,Dong2022a,Westerband2023}.


\begin{singlespace}
\subsection{\textit{Species identity traits modify effects of the environment on $\beta$, leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, and $N_\mathrm{area}$}}
\end{singlespace}
\noindent N-fixing species had greater $N_\mathrm{area}$ values on average compared to non-fixing species, a pattern driven by a stronger stimulation in $N_\mathrm{mass}$ in N-fixing species coupled with no change in $M_\mathrm{area}$ between species with different N-fixation ability. There was no evidence to suggest that N-fixing species had different $\beta$ or leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ values compared to non-fixing species across the environmental gradient. These results follow patterns from previous environmental gradient experiments that investigate variance in leaf nitrogen allocation in N-fixing species \shortcite{Adams2016,Dong2017,Dong2020}, and that increases in $N_\mathrm{mass}$ and $N_\mathrm{area}$ in N-fixing species are not necessarily correlated to increases in water use efficiency or reductions in leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ \shortcite{Adams2016}. While results are consistent with results from previous environmental gradient experiments, they do not support hypotheses presented here or patterns expected form theory, which predicts that stimulations in $N_\mathrm{area}$ by N-fixing species should be driven by a reduction in $\beta$ relative to non-fixing species, and that this response should decrease stomatal conductance and leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$.
    
C$_4$ species had reduced $\beta$, leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$, and $N_\mathrm{area}$ than C$_3$ species. Reduced $\beta$ and leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ values in C$_4$ species follow hypotheses listed above, a pattern that could be the result of either reduced costs of nitrogen acquisition and use, increased costs of water acquisition and use, or both \shortcite{Wright2003,Prentice2014}. Results also indicate that $\beta$ in C$_4$ nonlegumes was unresponsive to changes in soil nitrogen availability despite an apparent negative effect of increasing soil nitrogen availability on $\beta$ in C$_3$ legumes and C$_3$ nonlegumes. Combined with a general null response of $\beta$ to soil moisture regardless of plant functional group, these patterns imply that reduced $\beta$ values in C$_4$ species may be the result of lower costs of nitrogen acquisition and use relative to C$_3$ species. While lower $\beta$ values in C$_4$ species provides a possible explanation for why C$_4$ species often have lower leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and greater water use efficiency, theory predicts that this response should cause C$_4$ species to have greater $N_\mathrm{area}$ values compared to C$_3$ species, though C$_4$ species commonly exhibit lower $N_\mathrm{area}$ and higher nitrogen use efficiency than C$_3$ species \shortcite{Schmitt1981,Sage1987_c3c4,Ghannoum2011}. We speculate that lowered costs of nitrogen acquisition and use in C$_4$ species could be driven by more efficient Rubisco carboxylation efficiency in C$_4$ species associated with CO$_2$ concentrating mechanisms that eliminate photorespiration \shortcite{Ghannoum2011}, which could reduce or eliminate the need to sacrifice inefficient nitrogen use for efficient water use to achieve optimal photosynthesis rates.

\subsection{\textit{Next steps for optimality model development}}
\noindent Optimality models for both C$_3$ and C$_4$ species have been developed using principles from photosynthetic least-cost theory \shortcite{Prentice2014,Wang2017,Smith2019,Stocker2020,Scott2022}. In both C$_3$ and C$_4$ model variants, $\beta$ values are held constant using global datasets of leaf $\delta^{13}$C \shortcite{Wang2017,Cornwell2018}. Specifically, the C$_3$ optimality model initially assumed a constant $\beta$ value of 240 \shortcite{Wang2017}, later corrected to 146 \shortcite{Stocker2020}, while the C$_4$ optimality model assumes a constant $\beta$ value of 166 \shortcite{Scott2022}. These results, which build on findings from \shortciteN{Paillassa2020} and \shortciteN{Lavergne2020}, demonstrate high variability in calculated $\beta$ values across the environmental gradient. Specifically, $\beta$ values in C$_3$ species ranged from 1.7 to 188.0 (mean: 30.2; median: 23.1; standard deviation: 25.4), while ranged from 0.1 to 110.6 in C$_4$ species (mean: 7.2; median: 0.7; standard deviation: 18.6). Mean $\beta$ values in both C$_3$ and C$_4$ species were consistently lower than values currently implemented in optimality models, though this was likely the result of increased water limitation across sites relative to global averages. Regardless, the high degree of $\beta$ variability across this environmental gradient, together with findings from \shortciteN{Lavergne2020} and \shortciteN{Paillassa2020}, suggests that the use of constant $\beta$ values may contribute to erroneous errors when conducting optimality model simulations. Results from this experiment build on suggestions from \shortciteN{Wang2017}, suggesting that future photosynthetic least-cost optimality model developments should consider adopting frameworks for dynamically calculating $\beta$.

\subsection{\textit{Conclusions}}
\noindent To summarize, variability in $N_\mathrm{area}$ across an environmental gradient in Texan grasslands was driven by indirect effects of climate and soil resource availability mediated. Results from this experiment provide strong and consistent support for patterns expected from photosynthetic least-cost theory, demonstrating that negative relationships between $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and $N_\mathrm{area}$ unify expected effects of climatic and edaphic characteristics on $N_\mathrm{area}$ across environmental gradients. Results reported here also demonstrate a need to consider the dynamic nature of the relative cost of nitrogen versus water uptake ($\beta$) across environmental gradients in optimality models that leverage principles of photosynthetic least-cost theory.
