Overall: Work on direct writing with active verbs. Avoid passive voice. Avoid vage and verbose prepositional phrases.

## Chapter 2

- Why those two species? One Malvaceae and one Fabaceae. I mean, they are both Rosids but seemingly chosen randomly out of thousands of possibilities?  What can one learn by just growing two random species out of hundreds of thousands? You need to justify this or it is a huge surprise..]. They are both cultivated crops. Any reason to think they are representative of strategies in general?

- "temporary state of diminishing return associated with investing carbon toward building and maintaining structures that are necessary to support enhanced nitrogen uptake, ..." A temporary state of diminishing returns? I don't follow. Can you show the functions as figures?

- Figures in Ch 2: Slopes are from mixed model, but model was on transformed dependent variables. How are relationships linear in arithmetic space? I don't understand this.

- Figures: "points are jittered". Must explain. I assume only in x axis because x values were set rather than measured?


## Chapter 3 ##

- Species differences! Implications for CH2?
- "spins up" slang? What does this mean? "Spun up" -- jargon.
- Line 1407: Sure? I donl;t think an TX  Rhamnaceae are N fixers, only Ceanothus.  But Cercrcarpus? No Frankia using species?
