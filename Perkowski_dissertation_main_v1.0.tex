\chapter{\textbf{Acknowledgements}}
This dissertation was made possible by the mentorship, collaboration, and friendship of many people. I am so thankful to be surrounded by such supportive and helpful mentors, peers, and friends that have made navigating through graduate school and finishing this dissertation an enjoyable experience. Specifically, I am thankful for the incredible mentorship of my advisor and committee chair, Dr. Nick Smith, who provided invaluable insight and tools that have helped shape me into the plant ecophysiologist I claim to be today. I am also indebted to my committee members, Drs. Aimée Classen, Natasja van Gestel, Dylan Schwilk, and Lindsey Slaughter, for useful feedback, invaluable support, and encouragement as I planned and implemented experiments.

I am also thankful for past and present members of the EcoHealth lab for encouragement, support, and extracurricular activities that made time inside and outside the lab enjoyable and memorable. Particular thanks go to Dr. Lizz Waring, Dr. Xiulin Gao, Helen Scott, and Risa McNellis, Billi Jean Petermann, and the late Dr. Kris Petterson, all of whom were invaluable to helping me navigate my first year. I am especially thankful for the mentorship and friendship of Dr. Lizz Waring, as our weekly coffee chats were instrumental for helping me feel welcome in Lubbock and acclimate to life as a graduate student. I am also grateful for the friendship of Billi Jean Petermann and the late Dr. Kris Petterson for their encouragement and willingness to discuss microbial symbioses over coffee on random Saturday mornings.

Additional thanks go out to Isa Beltran, Snehanjana Chatterjee, Jeff Chi-eppa, Peter Eludini, Zinny Ezekannagha, Hannah German, Eve Gray, Monika Kelley, Azaj Mahmud, Jorge Ochoa, Brad Posch, Avery Schoenherr, and Jose Villeda for help with experiments or for lending an ear over puzzling results. I am also thankful for collaborators Dr. Christy Goodale and Dave Frey, who provided invaluable insight for the second experimental chapter.

I would like to thank my undergraduate advisor, Dr. Janice Krumm, for continued mentorship and friendship and for insightful advice about navigating graduate school, but most of all for helping me realize my career aspirations and pushing me to pursue this endeavor. Additional thanks go out to my family, particularly my parents, partner, and dog for continued support and distractions outside the lab. The experiments included here would not have been possible without their emotional and monetary support.

This work was made possible from funding by the NSF, USDA, Braun and Gresham, PLLC., and was a contribution to the LEMONTREE (Land Ecosystem Models based On New Theory, obseRvations and ExperimEnts) project. The LEMONTREE project is funded through the generosity of Eric and Wendy Schmidt by recommendation of the Schmidt Futures programme and the Imperial College initiative on Grand Challenges in Ecosystems and the Environment. This work was also funded by graduate student research awards from Texas Tech University and the Botanical Society of America.

I have inevitably missed mentioning folks that were instrumental to the completion of these experiments and contributed to my development as a plant physiological ecologist. Please know that I am grateful and appreciative of our interactions.

\chapter{\textbf{Abstract}}
Photosynthesis is the largest carbon flux between the atmosphere and is constrained by ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycle dynamics, which causes terrestrial biosphere models to be sensitive to the formulation of photosynthetic processes. Terrestrial biosphere models exhibit high divergence in simulated carbon and nitrogen fluxes under future environmental conditions, which may due to uncertainty in the acclimation response of photosynthetic processes to environmental change. Photosynthetic least-cost theory provides a promising framework for understanding effects of climatic and edaphic factors on photosynthetic acclimation responses to changing environments. Yet, empirical tests of the theory are rare, limiting our ability to assess whether the theory is suitable for implementation in next-generation terrestrial biosphere models.

Here, I present four experiments designed to test assumptions of photosynthetic least-cost theory using a combination of greenhouse, growth chamber, field manipulation, and field gradient experiments. Experiment chapters are flanked by a general introduction chapter and conclusions chapter. The first experimental chapter quantifies structural carbon costs to acquire nitrogen in \textit{Glycine max} and \textit{Gossypium hirsutum} grown under four nitrogen fertilization levels and four light availability levels in a full factorial greenhouse experiment. I find that carbon costs to acquire nitrogen in both species increase with increasing light availability and decrease with increasing fertilization, though responses to fertilization in \textit{G. max} were markedly less than \textit{G. hirsutum}. The second experimental chapter quantifies leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic traits in upper canopy leaves of deciduous trees growing in a 9-year nitrogen-by-sulfur field manipulation experiment. I find strong evidence for nitrogen-water use tradeoffs with increasing soil nitrogen availability, evidenced through a strong negative relationship between leaf nitrogen content and leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$ and stronger increase in leaf nitrogen content with increasing soil nitrogen availability than leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. The third experiment investigates variance in leaf nitrogen content across a climate and soil resource availability gradient in Texan grasslands, showing that effects of soil resource availability and climate on leaf nitrogen content are driven by changes in leaf $C_\mathrm{i}$:$C_\mathrm{a}$. Finally, the fourth experiment quantifies leaf and whole plant acclimation responses in \textit{G. max} grown under two atmospheric CO$_2$ levels, with and without inoculation with \textit{Bradyrhizobium japonicum}, and across nine nitrogen fertilization treatments in a full factorial growth chamber experiment. I find that leaf acclimation responses to CO$_2$ were independent of soil nitrogen fertilization or inoculation treatment, though stimulations in whole plant growth under elevated CO$_2$ were enhanced with increasing soil nitrogen fertilization and in inoculated pots under low nitrogen fertilization. 

Experiments included in this dissertation provide consistent support for patterns expected from photosynthetic least-cost theory. The use of multiple experimental approaches allowed me to examine mechanisms driving patterns expected from the theory and investigate whether these patterns occur naturally across environmental gradients. Findings from these chapters challenge common paradigms in plant ecophysiology, providing evidence that including photosynthetic least-cost frameworks in next-generation terrestrial biosphere models may improve the observed divergence in simulated outcomes across terrestrial biosphere model products.
