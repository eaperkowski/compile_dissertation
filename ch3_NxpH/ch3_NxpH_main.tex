    \section{Introduction}

    Photosynthesis represents the largest carbon flux between the atmosphere and land surface \shortcite{IPCC2021}, and plays a central role in biogeochemical cycling at multiple spatial and temporal scales \shortcite{Vitousek1991,LeBauer2008,Kaiser2015,Wieder2015_NPP}. Therefore, carbon and energy fluxes simulated by terrestrial biosphere models are sensitive to the formulation of photosynthetic processes \shortcite{Ziehn2011,Bonan2011,Booth2012,Smith2016,Smith2017} and must be represented using robust, empirically tested processes \shortcite{Prentice2015,Wieder2019}. Current formulations of photosynthesis vary across terrestrial biosphere models \shortcite{Smith2013,Rogers2017a}, which causes variation in modeled ecosystem processes \shortcite{Knorr2000,KnorrHeimann2001,Bonan2011,Friedlingstein2014} and casts uncertainty on the ability of these models to accurately predict terrestrial ecosystem responses and feedbacks to global change \shortcite{Zaehle2005,Schaefer2012,Davies-Barnard2020}.
