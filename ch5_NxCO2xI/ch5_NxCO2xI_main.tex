    \section{Introduction}

    Terrestrial ecosystems are regulated by complex carbon and nitrogen cycles. As a result, terrestrial biosphere models, which are beginning to include coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles \shortcite{Shi2016,Davies-Barnard2020,Braghiere2022}, must accurately represent these cycles under different environmental scenarios to reliably simulate carbon and nitrogen atmosphere-biosphere fluxes \shortciteN{Hungate2003,Prentice2015}. 
    %While the inclusion of coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles tends to reduce model uncertainty (Arora et al., 2020), large uncertainty in role of soil nitrogen availability and nitrogen acquisition strategy on leaf and whole plant acclimation responses to CO2 remains (Smith & Dukes, 2013; Terrer et al., 2018; Smith & Keenan, 2020). This source of uncertainty likely contributes to the widespread divergence in future carbon and nitrogen flux simulations across terrestrial biosphere models (Friedlingstein et al., 2014; Zaehle et al., 2014; Meyerholt et al., 2020).
