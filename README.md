This repository contains files relevant to Evan Perkowski's dissertation investigating leaf nutrient acquisition and allocation responses to global change. The repository includes unique folders for each experimental chapter, in which each folder includes .tex and .aux files needed to compile chapters and a subfolder that contains .png files of figures.

LaTeX source files are included, in addition to the document class file that defines the compilation method. A PDF of the most recently compiled PDF is included with the other source files.
