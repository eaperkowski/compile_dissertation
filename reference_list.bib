abstract = {Climate warming is expected to have particularly strong effects on tundra and boreal ecosystems, yet relatively few studies have examined soil responses to temperature change in these systems. We used closed-top greenhouses to examine the response of soil respiration, nutrient availability, microbial abundance, and active fungal communities to soil warming in an Alaskan boreal forest dominated by mature black spruce. This treatment raised soil temperature by 0.5°C and also resulted in a 22% decline in soil water content. We hypothesized that microbial abundance and activity would increase with the greenhouse treatment. Instead, we found that bacterial and fungal abundance declined by over 50%, and there was a trend toward lower activity of the chitin-degrading enzyme N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. Soil respiration also declined by up to 50%, but only late in the growing season. These changes were accompanied by significant shifts in the community structure of active fungi, with decreased relative abundance of a dominant Thelephoroid fungus and increased relative abundance of Ascomycetes and Zygomycetes in response to warming. In line with our hypothesis, we found that warming marginally increased soil ammonium and nitrate availability as well as the overall diversity of active fungi. Our results indicate that rising temperatures in northern-latitude ecosystems may not always cause a positive feedback to the soil carbon cycle, particularly in boreal forests with drier soils. Models of carbon cycle-climate feedbacks could increase their predictive power by incorporating heterogeneity in soil properties and microbial communities across the boreal zone. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {The interspecific complementary and competitive interactions between pea (Pisum sativum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), grown as dual and tri-component intercrops were assessed in a field study in Denmark. Total biomass production and N use at two levels of N fertilisation (0.5 and 4.0 g N/m 2 ), were measured at five harvests throughout a growing season. All intercrops displayed land equivalent ratio values close to or exceeding unity, indicating complementary use of growth resources. Whereas both rape and barley responded positively to increased N fertilisation, irrespective of whether they were grown as sole- or intercrops, pea was strongly suppressed when grown in intercrop. Of the three crops barley was the strongest competitor for both soil and fertiliser N, rape intermediate and pea the weakest. Faster initial growth of barley than pea and rape gave barley an initial competitive advantage, an advantage that in the two dual intercrops was strengthened by the addition of N. Apparently the competitive superiority of barley was less strong in the tri-component intercrop, in- dicating that the impact of the dominant may, through improved growth of both rape and pea, have been diminished through indirect facilitation. Interspecific competition had a promoting effect on the percent of nitrogen derived from N 2 fixation of pea, and most so at the low N fertilisation level. Results indicate that the benefits achieved from the association of a legume and nonlegume, in terms of N 2 fixed were greatest when pea was grown in association with rape as opposed to barley which could indicate that the benefits achieved from the association of a legume and nonlegume are partly lost if the nonlegume is too strong a competitor.},

abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi form mutualistic symbioses with many tree species and are regarded as key organisms in nutrient and carbon cycles in forest ecosystems. Our appreciation of their roles in these processes is hampered by a lack of understanding of their soil-borne mycelial systems. These mycelia represent the vegetative thalli of ECM fungi that link carbon-yielding tree roots with soil nutrients, yet we remain largely ignorant of their distribution, dynamics and activities in forest soils. In this review we consider information derived from investigations of fruiting bodies, ECM root tips and laboratory-based microcosm studies, and conclude that these provide only limited insights into soil-borne ECM mycelial communities. Recent advances in understanding soil-borne mycelia of ECM fungi have arisen from the combined use of molecular technologies and novel field experimentation. These approaches have the potential to provide unprecedented insights into the functioning of ECM mycelia at the ecosystem level, particularly in the context of land-use changes and global climate change.},

abstract = {Background: Nitrogen fixation has been quantified for a range of crop legumes and actinorhizal plants under different agricultural/agroforestry conditions, but much less is known of legume and actinorhizal plant N2fixation in natural ecosystems. Aims: To assess the proportion of total plant N derived from the atmosphere via the process of N2fixation (%Ndfa) by actinorhizal and legume plants in natural ecosystems and their N input into these ecosystems as indicated by their 15N natural abundance. Methods: A comprehensive collation of published values of %Ndfa for legumes and actinorhizal plants in natural ecosystems and their N input into these ecosystems as estimated by their 15N natural abundance was carried out by searching the ISI Web of Science database using relevant key words. Results: The %Ndfa was consistently large for actinorhizal plants but very variable for legumes in natural ecosystems, and the average value for %Ndfa was substantially greater for actinorhizal plants. High soil N, in particular, but also low soil P and water content were correlated with low legume N2fixation. N input into ecosystems from N2fixation was very variable for actinorhizal and legume plants and greatly dependent on their biomass within the system. Conclusions: Measurement of 15N natural abundance has given greater understanding of where legume and actinorhizal plant N2fixation is important in natural ecosystems. Across studies, the average value for %Ndfa was substantially greater for actinorhizal plants than for legumes, and the relative abilities of the two groups of plants to utilise mineral N requires further study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Belowground plant responses have received much less attention in climate change experiments than aboveground plant responses, thus hampering a holistic understanding of climate change effects on plants and ecosystems. In addition, responses of plant roots to climate change have mostly been studied in single-factor experiments. In a Danish heathland ecosystem, we investigated both individual and combined effects of elevated CO2, warming and drought on fine root length, net production and standing biomass by the use of minirhizotrons, ingrowth cores and soil coring. Warming increased the net root production from ingrowth cores, but decreased fine root number and length in minirhizotrons, whereas there were no significant main effects of drought. Across all treatments and soil depths, CO2 stimulated both the total fine root length (+44%) and the number of roots observed (+39%), with highest relative increase in root length in the deeper soil layers. Our results suggest that under future climate, plants may allocate considerable resources into roots compared to aboveground biomass. Increased carbon (C) allocation to roots may have a great impact on the overall ecosystem C balance and must be considered in modelling of future ecosystem responses to climate change. To provide models with necessary validation data, more studies are needed to investigate if higher C allocation to roots will lead to long-term C storage in more recalcitrant soil C pools or if this potential increase in soil carbon storage may be offset by increased priming activity and turnover rates for soil organic matter.},

Estimates based on seasonal net plant N uptake, and those based on the amounts of NH4/+-N plus NO3/--N captured by ion exchange resin (IER) bags, did not differ in plots treated with ambient (355 $\mu$L L-1) and elevated (680 $\mu$L L-1) [CO2] in either the second (1993) or third (1994) growing season under treatment with elevated [CO2]. The results of this study suggest that the effects of rising atmospheric [CO2] on plant N availability may be negligible in this grassland. The results also contrast the relatively large effects of elevated atmospheric [CO2] (increases and decreases) reported for highly disturbed artificial systems.},

abstract = {The simulation of atmospheric-land-ocean CO2 exchange for the 1850-2000 period offers the possibility of testing and calibrating the carbon budget in earth system models by comparing the simulated changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and in land and ocean uptake with observation-based information. In particular, some of the uncertainties associated with the treatment of land use change (LUC) and the role of down regulation in affecting the strength of CO2 fertilization for terrestrial photosynthesis are assessed using the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Earth System Model (CanESM1). LUC emissions may be specified as an external source of CO2 or calculated interactively based on estimated changes in crop area. The evidence for photosynthetic down regulation is reviewed and an empirically based representation is implemented and tested in the model. Four fully coupled simulations are performed: with and without terrestrial photosynthesis down regulation and with interactively determined or specified LUC emissions. Simulations without terrestrial photosynthesis down regulation yield 15-20 ppm lower atmospheric CO2 by the end of the twentieth century, compared to observations, regardless of the LUC approach used because of higher carbon uptake by land. Implementation of down regulation brings simulated values of atmospheric CO2 and land and ocean carbon uptake closer to observation-based values. The use of specified LUC emissions yields a large source in the tropics during the 1981-2000 period, which is inconsistent with studies suggesting the tropics to be near-neutral or small carbon sinks. The annual cycle of simulated global averaged CO2, dominated by the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration cycles, is reasonably well reproduced, as is the latitudinal distribution of CO2 and the dependence of interhemispheric CO2 gradient on fossil fuel emissions. The empirical approach used here offers a reasonable method of implementing down regulation in coupled carbon-climate models in the absence of a more explicit biogeochemical representation. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Climate warming could shift some subtropical regions to a tropical climate in the next 30 years. Yet, climate warming impacts on subtropical species and ecosystems remain unclear. We conducted a passive warming experiment in a subtropical forest in Florida, USA, to determine warming impacts on four species differing in their climatic distribution, growth form, and functional type: Serenoa repens (palm), Andropogon glomeratus (C4 grass), Pinus palustris (needled evergreen tree), and Quercus laevis (broadleaved deciduous tree). We hypothesized that warming would have neutral-positive effects on photosynthetic processes in monocot species with warmer climatic distributions or adaptations to warmer temperatures, but negative effects on photosynthesis in tree species. We also hypothesized that periods of low soil moisture would alter photosynthetic responses to warming. In both monocot species, warming had no significant effect on net photosynthesis (A) or stomatal conductance (gs) measured at prevailing temperatures, or photosynthetic capacity measured at a common temperature. In P. palustris, warming reduced A (−15%) and gs (−28%), and caused small reductions in Rubisco carboxylation and RuBP regeneration. Warming had little effect on photosynthetic processes in Q. laevis. Interestingly, A. glomeratus showed little sensitivity to reduced soil moisture, and all C3 species reduced A and gs as soil moisture declined and did so consistently across temperature treatments. In subtropical forests of the southeastern US, we conclude that climate warming may have neutral or slightly positive effects on the performance of grasses and broadleaved species but negative effects on P. palustris seedlings, foreshadowing possible changes in community and ecosystem properties.},

abstract = {Ecosystems dominated by plants in symbiosis with ectomycorrhizal fungi store more carbon in soils. There is increasing evidence that this may be due to competition between primary producers and microbial decomposers for soil nitrogen, mediated by ectomycorrhizal fungi. This competitive interaction inhibits decomposition and increases soil carbon storage. However, other work suggests elevated carbon storage is due to recalcitrant plant tissue chemistry in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems, rather than ectomycorrhizal competition for soil nitrogen. These two frameworks make similar predictions for soil carbon storage, making them difficult to distinguish empirically. Here I argue that the ectomycorrhizal-recalcitrance hypothesis is not well supported by recent developments in the understanding of soil carbon chemistry, or evolutionary relationships among ectomycorrhizal plants. Therefore, differences in input chemistry are not sufficient to discount alternative mechanisms of carbon stabilization in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems. Future work on EM-specific stabilization of soil C should focus on alternative mechanisms including competition for N, direct antagonistic interactions, and other microbial community driven mechanisms.},

abstract = {Mycorrhizal fungi are critical members of the plant microbiome, forming a symbiosis with the roots of most plants on Earth. Most plant species partner with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi, and these symbioses are thought to represent plant adaptations to fast and slow soil nutrient cycling rates. This generates a second hypothesis, that arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal plant species traits complement and reinforce these fungal strategies, resulting in nutrient acquisitive vs. conservative plant trait profiles. Here we analyzed 17,764 species level trait observations from 2,940 woody plant species to show that mycorrhizal plants differ systematically in nitrogen and phosphorus economic traits. Differences were clearest in temperate latitudes, where ectomycorrhizal plant species are more nitrogen use- and phosphorus use-conservative than arbuscular mycorrhizal species. This difference is reflected in both aboveground and belowground plant traits and is robust to controlling for evolutionary history, nitrogen fixation ability, deciduousness, latitude, and species climate niche. Furthermore, mycorrhizal effects are large and frequently similar to or greater in magnitude than the influence of plant nitrogen fixation ability or deciduous vs. evergreen leaf habit. Ectomycorrhizal plants are also more nitrogen conservative than arbuscular plants in boreal and tropical ecosystems, although differences in phosphorus use are less apparent outside temperate latitudes. Our findings bolster current theories of ecosystems rooted in mycorrhizal ecology and support the hypothesis that plant mycorrhizal association is linked to the evolution of plant nutrient economic strategies.},

abstract = {Respiration of soil organic carbon is one of the largest fluxes of CO2 on earth. Understanding the processes that regulate soil respiration is critical for predicting future climate. Recent work has suggested that soil carbon respiration may be reduced by competition for nitrogen between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi that associate with plant roots and free-living microbial decomposers, which is consistent with increased soil carbon storage in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems globally. However, experimental tests of the mycorrhizal competition hypothesis are lacking. Here we show that ectomycorrhizal roots and hyphae decrease soil carbon respiration rates by up to 67% under field conditions in two separate field exclusion experiments, and this likely occurs via competition for soil nitrogen, an effect larger than 2 °C soil warming. These findings support mycorrhizal competition for nitrogen as an independent driver of soil carbon balance and demonstrate the need to understand microbial community interactions to predict ecosystem feedbacks to global climate.},

abstract = {Soil contains more carbon than the atmosphere and vegetation combined. Understanding the mechanisms controlling the accumulation and stability of soil carbon is critical to predicting the Earth's future climate. Recent studies suggest that decomposition of soil organic matter is often limited by nitrogen availability to microbes and that plants, via their fungal symbionts, compete directly with free-living decomposers for nitrogen. Ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal (EEM) fungi produce nitrogen-degrading enzymes, allowing them greater access to organic nitrogen sources than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. This leads to the theoretical prediction that soil carbon storage is greater in ecosystems dominated by EEM fungi than in those dominated by AM fungi. Using global data sets, we show that soil in ecosystems dominated by EEM-associated plants contains 70% more carbon per unit nitrogen than soil in ecosystems dominated by AM-associated plants. The effect of mycorrhizal type on soil carbon is independent of, and of far larger consequence than, the effects of net primary production, temperature, precipitation and soil clay content. Hence the effect of mycorrhizal type on soil carbon content holds at the global scale. This finding links the functional traits of mycorrhizal fungi to carbon storage at ecosystem-to-global scales, suggesting that plant-decomposer competition for nutrients exerts a fundamental control over the terrestrial carbon cycle.},

Belowground carbon allocation and soil respiration should thus reflect plant effort allocated to nutrient uptake, for example in conditions of different nutrient availabilities con- trolled by site quality or stand history. Soil respiration, belowground C allocation, and fine root biomass were measured in three sites differing in nutrient availability in the northern hardwood forests of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Annual soil respiration and belowground C allocation measured in two stands at each site were lowest at Jeffers Brook, the site with highest nutrient availability, and higher at Hubbard Brook and Bartlett Experimental Forests. Neither soil respiration nor belowground C allocation differed significantly between mid-aged (31–41 year old) and older stands (>80 year old) within the sites, despite higher fine root (<1 mm) biomass in old stands than mid-aged stands. During the growing season, soil respiration was low where net nitrogen mineralization and net nitrification were high across an extensive sample of thirteen stands and annual belowground C allocation decreased with increasing nitrification across the six intensively studied stands. Available P was not related to soil respiration. The relationships among N availability, belowground C allocation, and soil respiration support the claim that forests allocate more C belowground in ecosystems with low availability of a limiting nutrient.},

Methods Seasonal changes in EMF production (in in- growth mesh bags) and soil water N (in suction lysim- eters) were analyzed after fertilization with N or N combined with P. The EMF N retention capacity was estimated by the addition of isotopically labeled N to the mesh bags. Results No relationship was found between the seasonal variation in EMF growth and N leakage from the soil. However, in the mesh bags, the total assimilation of 15 N by EMF was almost halved by N fertilization, while twice as much 15 N leached through. Conclusions We found a high specific N assimilation capacity per unit weight of EMF mycelia. This was unaffected by N fertilization, but the total assimilation of N by EMF was drastically reduced due to reduced production of EMM. However, N-retaining processes other than N assimilation by EMF must be taken into account to explain the losses of N after fertilization.},

abstract = {The study aimed to investigate the effects of commercially available AMF inoculate (Glomus sp. mixture) on the growth and the nutrient acquisition in tomato (Solanumlycopersicum L.) plants directly after transplanting and under different levels of salinity. Inoculated (AMF+) and non-inoculated (AMF -) tomato plants were subjected to three levels of NaCl salinity (0, 50, and 100 mM NaCl). Seven days after transplanting, plants were analyzed for dry matter and RGR of whole plants and root systems. Leaf tissue was analyzed for mineral concentration before and after transplanting; leaf nutrient content and relative uptake rates (RUR) were calculated. AMF inoculation did not affect plant dry matter or RGR under fresh water-irrigation. The growth rate of AMF plants did significantly decline under both moderate (77%) and severe (61%) salt stress compared to the fresh water-irrigated controls, while the decline was much less (88% and 75%,respectively)and statistically non-significant in salt-stressed AMF+ plants. Interestingly, root system dry matter of AMF+ plants (0.098 g plant-1) remained significantly greater under severe soil salinity compared to non-inoculated seedlings (0.082 g plant-1). The relative uptake rates of N, P, Mg, Ca, Mn, and Fe were enhanced in inoculated tomato seedlings and remained higher under (moderate) salt stress compared to AMF plants This study suggests that inoculation with commercial AMF during nursery establishment contributes to alleviation of salt stress by maintaining a favorable nutrient profile. Therefore, nursery inoculation seems to be a viable solution to attenuate the effects of increasing soil salinity levels, especially in greenhouses with low natural abundance of AMF spores.},

An understanding of soil microbial ecology is central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycle-climate feedbacks, but the complexity of the soil microbial community and the many ways that it can be affected by climate and other global changes hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions on this topic. In this paper, we argue that to understand the potential negative and positive contributions of soil microbes to land-atmosphere carbon exchange and global warming requires explicit consideration of both direct and indirect impacts of climate change on microorganisms. Moreover, we argue that this requires consideration of complex interactions and feedbacks that occur between microbes, plants and their physical environment in the context of climate change, and the influence of other global changes which have the capacity to amplify climate-driven effects on soil microbes. Overall, we emphasize the urgent need for greater understanding of how soil microbial ecology contributes to land-atmosphere carbon exchange in the context of climate change, and identify some challenges for the future. In particular, we highlight the need for a multifactor experimental approach to understand how soil microbes and their activities respond to climate change and consequences for carbon cycle feedbacks.},

The eastern side receives elevated N deposition from urban, agricultural, and industrial sources, compared with 1-2 kg N y -1 on the western side. Foliage of east side old-growth Englemann spruce forests have significantly lower C:N and lignin:N ratios and greater N:Mg and N:P ratios. Soil % N is higher, and C:N ratios lower in the east side stands, and potential net N mineralization rates are greater. Lake NO 3 concentrations are significantly higher in eastern lakes than western lakes. Two east side lakes studied paleolimnologically revealed rapid changes in diatom community composition and increased bio-volumes and cell concentrations. The diatom flora is now representative of increased disturbance or eutrophication. Sediment nitrogen isotopic ratios have become progressively lighter over the past 50 years, coincident with the change in algal flora, possibly from an influx of isotopically light N volatilized from agricultural fields and feedlots. Seventy-five percent of the increased east side soil N pool can be accounted for by increased N deposition commensurate with human settlement. Nitrogen emissions from fixed, mobile, and agricultural sources have increased dramatically since approximately 1950 to the east of the Colorado Front Range, as they have in many parts of the world. Our findings indicate even slight increases in atmospheric deposition lead to measurable changes in ecosystem properties.},

abstract = {Much research has shown that environmental stress can induce adaptive and maladaptive phenotypic changes in organisms that persist for multiple generations. Such transgenerational phenotypic plasticity shrouds our understanding of the long-term consequences of ongoing anthropogenic pressures. 2. Here, we evaluated within- and transgenerational phenotypic responses to food stress in the freshwater crustacean, Daphnia. We reared 45 clones of Daphnia pulicaria each on high-quality Scenedesmus and low-quality (but also non-toxic) cyanobacteria (generation 1). Offspring produced by generation 1 adults were then reared on Scenedesmus (generation 2) and life history traits were measured across both generations. 3. The results show that Daphnia in generation 1 exhibited reduced fitness (i.e. delayed maturation, lower reproductive output, increased clutch interval) when reared in the presence of cyanobacteria as opposed to high-quality food. However, maternal stress had no clear influence on the fitness of offspring. That is, Daphnia in the second experimental generation had similar mean trait values, irrespective of whether their mothers were reared on cyanobacteria or high-quality food. 4. Signals of transgenerational life history effects were obscured, in part, by extensive clonal variation among Daphnia in the direction of transgenerational responses to cyanobacteria (i.e. adaptive and maladaptive plasticity). Further analyses demonstrated that such individual variance in plasticity might be open to selection and potentially offer a means of contemporary adaptation to cyanobacteria. Taken together, our results denote a link between the overall strength of transgenerational responses to the environment and the potential for rapid evolution in populations.},

abstract = {Temperate forests are predicted to play a key role as important sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, which could be enhanced by nitrogen (N) deposition. However, experimental evidence suggests that the impact of N deposition on temperate forest productivity may not be as great as originally assumed. We investigated how chronic N addition affects needle morphology, nitrogen metabolism (or partitioning) photosynthetic capacity and foliage productivity. The investigation is based at the Harvard Forest (MA) as part of a now 15-year long N amendment study. Foliar N content in red pine (Pinus resinosa) of the high N treatment has significantly increased, but this increase was accompanied by a de-coupling of the photosynthesis–N relationship. In addition needle longevity in the high N trees was significantly lower compared to the control trees. Conifers of the high N treatment did not use the surplus of N to optimize the amount of photosynthetically active metabolites. Instead N accumulated as soluble protein (other than Rubisco), amino acids and chlorophyll. Photosynthetic capacity in the control trees was about 50% higher than in the fertilized trees. These results indicate that the increase in leaf N is not accompanied by a greater capacity for carbon assimilation in the high N treatment. Using a simple model (PnET-Day) of canopy photosynthesis and carbon allocation, we assessed the long-term effect of these physiological changes on ecosystem carbon balance. The model results emphasize and reinforce the large difference between rates of carbon accumulation predicted to occur if net photosynthesis remained linearly related to foliar N concentration, and rates measured in the field.},

abstract = {Increased temperatures and concomitant changes in vegetation patterns are expected to dramatically alter the functioning of northern ecosystems over the next few decades. Predicting the ecosystem response to such a shift in climate and vegetation is complicated by the lack of knowledge about the links between aboveground biota and belowground process rates. Current models suggest that increasing temperatures and rising concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 will be partly mitigated by elevated C sequestration in plant biomass and soil. How- ever, empirical evidence does not always support this assumption, as elevated temperature and CO2 concentrations also accelerate the belowground C flux, in many cases extending to increased decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and ultimately resulting in decreased soil C stocks. The mechanism behind the increase has remained largely unknown, but it has been suggested that priming might be the causative agent. Here, we provide quantitative evidence of a strong coupling between root exudation, SOM decomposition, and release of plant available N caused by rhizosphere priming effects. As plants tend to increase belowground C allocation with increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations, priming effects need to be considered in our long-term analysis of soil C bud- gets in a changing environment. The extent of priming seems to be intimately linked to resource availability, as shifts in the stoichiometric nutrient demands of plants and microorganisms will lead to either cooperation (resulting in prim- ing) or competition (no priming will occur). The findings lead us on the way to resolve the varying response of primary production, SOM decomposition, and release of plant available N to elevated temperatures, CO2 concentrations, and N availability.},

abstract = {Climate change is altering the interactions among plants and soil organisms in ways that will alter the structure and function of ecosystems. We reviewed the literature and developed a map of studies focused on how the three most common types of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal [AM], ectomycorrhizal [EcM], and ericoid mycorrhizal [ErM] fungi) respond to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO2), climatic warming, and changes in the distribution of precipitation. Broadly, we ask how do mycorrhizal fungi respond to climate change, how do these responses vary by fungal type, and how do mycorrhizal traits influence plant adaptation, movement, or extinction in response to climatic change? First, we found that 92% of studies were conducted in the northern hemisphere, and plant host, ecosystem type and study location were only correlated with each other in the northern hemisphere because studies across all mycorrhizal fungal types were only common in the northern hemisphere. Second, we show that temperature and rainfall variability had more variable effects than eCO2 on mycorrhizal fungal structures, but these effects were context dependent. Third, while mycorrhizal fungal types vary in their responses to climate change, it appears that warming leads to more variable responses in ectomycorrhizal than in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Finally, we discuss common traits of mycorrhizal fungi that could aid in fungal and plant adaption to climate change. We posit that mycorrhizal fungi can buffer plant hosts against extinction risk, they can facilitate or retard the dispersal success of plants moving away from poor environments, and, by buffering host plants, they can enable host plant adaptation to new climates. All of these influences are, however, context dependent a finding that reflects the complex traits of mycorrhizal fungi as a group, the diversity of plant species they associate with and the variation in ecosystems in which they reside. Overall, while we point out many gaps in our understanding of the influence of climate changes on mycorrhizal fungi, we also highlight the large number of opportunities for researching plant and mycorrhizal fungal responses to and mitigation of climate changes.},

However, AM fungi can benefit plants in more ways than improved phosphorus nutrition and plant growth. For example, AM fungi can promote abiotic and biotic stress tolerance even when considered parasitic from a nutrient provision perspective. Other than being obligate biotrophs, very little is known about the benefits AM fungi gain from plants.

In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American trees, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-soil feedbacks. In soil collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees experienced negative feedback, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees displayed positive feedback. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-soil feedbacks, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in temperate forests.},

abstract = {With ongoing climate change, the probability of crossing environmental thresholds promoting abrupt changes in ecosystem structure and functioning is higher than ever. In drylands (areas where it rains <65% of what could be potentially evaporated), recent research has shown how the crossing of three aridity thresholds [at aridity (1-Aridity Index) values of 0.54, 0.70 and 0.80] leads to abrupt changes on ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Despite the importance of these findings and their implications to develop effective monitoring and adaptation actions to combat climate change and desertification, we lack a proper understanding of the mechanisms unleashing these abrupt shifts. Here we review multiple mechanisms that may explain the existence of aridity thresholds observed across global drylands, and discuss the potential amplification mechanisms that may underpin hypothetical abrupt temporal shifts with climate change. We propose that each aridity threshold is caused by different and specific mechanisms. The first threshold is mainly caused by physiological mechanisms of plant adaptation to water shortages. The second threshold is unleashed by different mechanisms involving soil processes and plant–soil interactions such as soil erosion, plant community shifts and nutrient cycling and circulation. The collapse of vegetation observed once the third aridity threshold (0.8) is crossed is caused by the mechanisms related to the survival limits of plants that may cause sudden cover and diversity losses and plant–atmospheric feedbacks that link vegetation collapse with further climate aridification. By identifying, revising and linking relevant mechanisms to each aridity threshold observed, we provide a set of specific hypotheses and identify knowledge gaps concerning the study of threshold emergence in drylands. We were also able to establish plausible factors that are context dependent and may influence the occurrence of abrupt ecosystem changes in time. Our review may help to focus future research efforts on aridity thresholds and to develop strategies to monitor, adapt to or even revert abrupt ecosystem changes across global drylands.

abstract = {Predicting the environmental responses of leaf photosynthesis is central to many models of changes in the future global carbon cycle and terrestrial biosphere. The steady-state biochemical model of C-3 photosynthesis of Farquhar et al. (Planta 149, 78-90, 1980) provides a basis for these larger scale predictions; but a weakness in the application of the model as currently parameterized is the inability to accurately predict carbon assimilation at the range of temperatures over which significant photosynthesis occurs in the natural environment. The temperature functions used in this model have been based on in vitro measurements made over a limited temperature range and require several assumptions of in vivo conditions. Since photosynthetic rates are often Rubisco-limited (ribulose, 1-5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) under natural steady-state conditions, inaccuracies in the functions predicting Rubisco kinetic properties at different temperatures may cause significant error. In this study, transgenic tobacco containing only 10% normal levels of Rubisco were used to measure Rubisco-limited photosynthesis over a large range of CO2 concentrations. From the responses of the rate of CO2 assimilation at a wide range of temperatures, and CO2 and O-2 concentrations, the temperature functions of Rubisco kinetic properties were estimated in vivo. These differed substantially from previously published functions. These new functions were then used to predict photosynthesis in lemon and found to faithfully mimic the observed pattern of temperature response. There was also a close correspondence with published C-3 photosynthesis temperature responses. The results represent an improved ability to model leaf photosynthesis over a wide range of temperatures (10-40 degreesC) necessary for predicting carbon uptake by terrestrial C-3 systems.},

abstract = {Mutualisms, beneficial interactions between species, are expected to be unstable because delivery of benefit likely involves fitness costs and selection should favour partners that deliver less benefit. Yet, mutualisms are common and persistent, even in the largely promiscuous associations between plants and soil microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In two different systems, we demonstrate preferential allocation of photosynthate by host plants to the more beneficial of two AM fungal symbionts. This preferential allocation could allow the persistence of the mutualism if it confers sufficient advantage to the beneficial symbiont that it overcomes the cost of mutualism. We find that the beneficial fungus does increase in biomass when the fungi are spatially separated within the root system. However, in well-mixed fungal communities, non-beneficial fungi proliferate as expected from their reduced cost of mutualism. Our findings suggest that preferential allocation within spatially structured microbial communities can stabilize mutualisms between plants and root symbionts. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

There were sig- nificant increase of root biomass by 39 and 44 % under elevated CO 2 and elevated CO 2 + temperature compared to ambient condition, respectively. A signif- icant increase (55 %) of total organic carbon in the root exudates under elevated CO 2 + temperature was noticed. Carbon dioxide enrichment associated with elevated temperature significantly increased soil labile carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and activities of carbon-transforming enzyme like $\beta$-glucosidase.

Changes in belowground fungal communities resulted in high costs of nutrient uptake for native perennials and a shift in plant traits linked to their water and nutrient use efficiencies. Some plants in the invaded community compensate for the disruption of nutritional symbionts and reduced nutrient provisioning by sanctioning more nitrogen to photosynthesis and expending more water, which demonstrates a trade-off in trait investment. For the first time, we show that the disruption of belowground nutritional symbionts can drive plants towards alternative regions of their trait space in order to maintain water and nutrient economics.},

abstract = {In light of rapid shifts in biodiversity associated with human impacts, there is an urgent need to understand how changing patterns in biodiversity impact ecosystem function. Functional redundancy is hypothesized to promote ecological resilience and stability, as ecosystem function of communities with more redundant species (those that perform similar functions) should be buffered against the loss of individual species. While functional redundancy is being increasingly quantified, few studies have linked differences in redundancy across communities to ecological outcomes. We conducted a review and meta-analysis to determine whether empirical evidence supports the asserted link between functional redundancy and ecosystem stability and resilience. We reviewed 423 research articles and assembled a data set of 32 studies from 15 articles across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Overall, the mean correlation between functional redundancy and ecological stability/resilience was positive. The mean positive effect of functional redundancy was greater for studies in which redundancy was measured as species richness within functional groups (vs. metrics independent of species richness), but species richness itself was not correlated with effect size. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that functional redundancy may positively affect community stability and resilience to disturbance, but more empirical work is needed including more experimental studies, partitioning of richness and redundancy effects, and links to ecosystem functions.},

The activity factor in turn controls microbial growth and death rates as well as the decomposition rate of insoluble organic matter and the immobilization rate of mineral N. The N-to-C ratios of microbial biomass are flexible dependent on the availability of N. The efficiency of microbial biosynthesis and maintenance respiration are controlled by the N-to-C ratio and activity state of the biomass. The behaviour of the model is investigated for conditions of batch and continuous input of substrate at different amounts of microbial activity and C and N in the soil. The proposed model structure is capable of reproducing such features of microbial turnover in soil as a transition of microbial population from an active to a dormant state in the case of C or N limitation, priming action on the decomposition of insoluble soil organic matter, and the reduced efficiency of microbial biosynthesis in the case of a N deficit.},

abstract = {Abstract Abstract Gross primary production (GPP) by terrestrial ecosystems is a key quantity in the global carbon cycle. The instantaneous controls of leaf-level photosynthesis are well established, but there is still no consensus on the mechanisms by which canopy-level GPP depends on spatial and temporal variation in the environment. The standard model of photosynthesis (Farquhar, von Caemmerer, & Berry, 1980) provides a robust mechanistic representation for C3 species, however additional assumptions are required to ?scale up? from leaf to canopy. As a consequence, competing models make inconsistent predictions about how GPP will respond to continuing environmental change. This problem is addressed here by means of an empirical analysis of the light use efficiency (LUE) of GPP inferred from eddy-covariance carbon dioxide flux measurements, in situ measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and remotely sensed estimates of the fraction of PAR (fAPAR) absorbed by the vegetation canopy. Focusing on LUE allows potential drivers of GPP to be separated from its overriding dependence on light. GPP data from over 100 sites, collated over 20?years and located in a range of biomes and climate zones, were extracted from the FLUXNET2015 database and combined with remotely sensed fAPAR data to estimate daily LUE. Daytime air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, diffuse fraction of solar radiation and soil moisture were shown to be salient predictors of LUE in a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The same model design was fitted to site-based LUE estimates generated by 16 terrestrial ecosystem models. The published models showed wide variation in the shape, the strength and even the sign of the environmental effects on modelled LUE. These findings highlight important model deficiencies and suggest a need to progress beyond simple ?goodness of fit? comparisons of inferred and predicted carbon fluxes towards an approach focused on the functional responses of the underlying dependencies.},

abstract = {Decomposition is a large term in the global carbon budget, but models of the earth system that simulate carbon cycle-climate feedbacks are largely untested with respect to litter decomposition. We tested the litter decomposition parameterization of the community land model version 4 (CLM4), the terrestrial component of the community earth system model, with data from the long-term intersite decomposition experiment team (LIDET). The LIDET dataset is a 10-year study of litter decomposition at multiple sites across North America and Central America. We performed 10-year litter decomposition simulations comparable with LIDET for 9 litter types and 20 sites in tundra, grassland, and boreal, conifer, deciduous, and tropical forest biomes using the LIDET-provided climatic decomposition index to constrain temperature and moisture effects on decomposition. We performed additional simulations with DAYCENT, a version of the CENTURY model, to ask how well an established ecosystem model matches the observations. The results show large discrepancy between the laboratory microcosm studies used to parameterize the CLM4 litter decomposition and the LIDET field study. Simulated carbon loss is more rapid than the observations across all sites, and nitrogen immobilization is biased high. Closer agreement with the observations requires much lower decomposition rates, obtained with the assumption that soil mineral nitrogen severely limits decomposition. DAYCENT better replicates the observations, for both carbon mass remaining and nitrogen, independent of nitrogen limitation. CLM4 has low soil carbon in global earth system simulations. These results suggest that this bias arises, in part, from too rapid litter decomposition. More broadly, the terrestrial biogeochemistry of earth system models must be critically tested with observations, and the consequences of particular model choices must be documented. Long-term litter decomposition experiments such as LIDET provide a real-world process-oriented benchmark to evaluate models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The divergence among Earth system models in the terrestrial carbon cycle has prompted interest in how to reduce uncertainty. Previous studies have identified model structural uncertainty arising from process parameterizations and parameter values. The current study highlights the importance of climate forcing in generating carbon cycle uncertainty. We use simulations in which three models (Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4), CLM4.5, CLM5) with substantially different carbon cycles are forced with two climate reconstructions (CRUNCEPv7, Global Soil Wetness Project 3 version 1 (GSWP3v1)) to examine the contributions of model structure and climate to uncertainty in the carbon cycle over the period 1850–2014. Climate uncertainty for global annual net biome production exceeds one third of total uncertainty (defined as the sum of climate and model structure uncertainty) in the first half of the twentieth century, but declines after the 1950s. Global annual gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, heterotrophic respiration, and vegetation and soil carbon stocks have substantial climate uncertainty (relative to total uncertainty) throughout the simulation period. Climate forcing contributes more than one half of total uncertainty for these carbon cycle fluxes and stocks throughout boreal North America and Eurasia, some midlatitude regions, and in eastern Amazonia and western equatorial Africa during the decade 2000–2009. Comparison with observationally based data sets of the carbon cycle using model benchmarking methods provides insight into strengths and deficiencies among models and climate forcings, but we caution against overreliance on benchmarking to discriminate among models. The conceptualization of uncertainty arising from this study implies embracing multiple feasible model simulations rather than focusing on which model or simulation is best.},

abstract = {Global soils store at least twice as much carbon as Earth's atmosphere1,2. The global soil-to-atmosphere (or total soil respiration, RS) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is increasing3,4, but the degree to which climate change will stimulate carbon losses from soils as a result of heterotrophic respiration (RH) remains highly uncertain5–8. Here we use an updated global soil respiration database9 to show that the observed soil surface RH:RS ratio increased significantly, from 0.54 to 0.63, between 1990 and 2014 (P = 0.009). Three additional lines of evidence provide support for this finding. By analysing two separate global gross primary production datasets10,11, we find that the ratios of both RH and RS to gross primary production have increased over time. Similarly, significant increases in RH are observed against the longest available solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence global dataset, as well as gross primary production computed by an ensemble of global land models. We also show that the ratio of night-time net ecosystem exchange to gross primary production is rising across the FLUXNET201512 dataset. All trends are robust to sampling variability in ecosystem type, disturbance, methodology, CO2 fertilization effects and mean climate. Taken together, our findings provide observational evidence that global RH is rising, probably in response to environmental changes, consistent with meta-analyses13–16 and long-term experiments17. This suggests that climate-driven losses of soil carbon are currently occurring across many ecosystems, with a detectable and sustained trend emerging at the global scale.},

abstract = {Unknowns in future global warming are usually assumed to arise from uncertainties either in the amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or in the sensitivity of the climate to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Characterizing the additional uncertainty in relating CO2 emissions to atmospheric concentrations has relied on either a small number of complex models with diversity in process representations, or simple models. To date, these models indicate that the relevant carbon cycle uncertainties are smaller than the uncertainties in physical climate feedbacks and emissions. Here, for a single emissions scenario, we use a full coupled climate–carbon cycle model and a systematic method to explore uncertainties in the land carbon cycle feedback. We find a plausible range of climate–carbon cycle feedbacks significantly larger than previously estimated. Indeed the range of CO2 concentrations arising from our single emissions scenario is greater than that previously estimated across the full range of IPCC SRES emissions scenarios with carbon cycle uncertainties ignored. The sensitivity of photosynthetic metabolism to temperature emerges as the most important uncertainty. This highlights an aspect of current land carbon modelling where there are open questions about the potential role of plant acclimation to increasing temperatures. There is an urgent need for better understanding of plant photosynthetic responses to high temperature, as these responses are shown here to be key contributors to the magnitude of future change.},

abstract = {Summary: Advancing the field of ecology relies on understanding generalities and developing theories based on empirical and functional relationships that integrate across organismal to global spatial scales and span temporal scales. Significant advances in predicting responses of ecological communities to globally extensive anthropogenic perturbations, for example, require understanding the role of environmental context in determining outcomes, which in turn requires standardized experiments across sites and regions. Distributed collaborative experiments can lead to high-impact advances that would otherwise be unachievable. Here, we provide specific advice and considerations relevant to researchers interested in employing this emerging approach using as a case study our experience developing and running the Nutrient Network, a globally distributed experimental network (currently >75 sites in 17 countries) that arose from a grassroots, cooperative research effort. We clarify the design, goals and function of the Nutrient Network as a model to empower others in the scientific community to employ distributed experiments to advance our predictive understanding of global-scale ecological trends and responses. Our experiences to date demonstrate that globally distributed experimental science need not be prohibitively expensive or time-consuming on a per capita basis and is not limited to senior scientists or countries where science is well funded. While distributed experiments are not a panacea for understanding ecological systems, they can substantially complement existing approaches. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Although plant strategies for acquiring nutrients have been widely studied from a functional point of view, their evolution is still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of these strategies and determine how they influence ecosystem properties. To do so, we use a simple nutrient-limited ecosystem model in which plant ability to take up nutrients is subject to adaptive dynamics. We postulate the existence of a trade-off between this ability and mortality. We show that contrasting strategies are possible as evolutionary outcomes, depending on the shape of the trade-off and, when nitrogen is considered as the limiting nutrient, on the intensity of symbiotic fixation. Our model enables us to bridge these evolutionary outcomes to classical ecological theories such as Hardin's tragedy of the commons and Tilman's rule of R *. Evolution does not systematically maximize plant biomass or primary productivity. On the other hand, each evolutionary outcome leads to a decrease in the availability of the limiting mineral nutrient, supporting the work of Tilman on competition between plants for a single resource. Our model shows that evolution can be used to link different classical ecological results and that adaptation may influence ecosystem properties in contrasted ways.},

abstract = {Climate change will alter both the amount and pattern of precipitation and soil water availability, which will directly affect plant growth and nutrient acquisition, and potentially, ecosystem functions like nutrient cycling and losses as well. Given their role in facilitating plant nutrient acquisition and water stress resistance, arbus- cular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may modulate the effects of changing water availability on plants and ecosystem functions. The well-characterized mycorrhizal tomato (Sola- num lycopersicum L.) genotype 76R (referred to as MYC+) and the mutant mycor- rhiza-defective tomato genotype rmc were grown in microcosms in a glasshouse experiment manipulating both the pattern and amount of water supply in unsteril- ized field soil. Following 4 weeks of differing water regimes, we tested how AM fungi affected plant productivity and nutrient acquisition, short-term interception of a 15 NHþ 4 pulse, and inorganic nitrogen (N) leaching from microcosms. AM fungi enhanced plant nutrient acquisition with both lower and more variable water avail- ability, for instance increasing plant P uptake more with a pulsed water supply com- pared to a regular supply and increasing shoot N concentration more when lower water amounts were applied. Although uptake of the short-term 15 NHþ 4 pulse was higher in rmc plants, possibly due to higher N demand, AM fungi subtly modulated NO 3 leaching, decreasing losses by 54% at low and high water levels in the regular water regime, with small absolute amounts of NO 3 leached (<1 kg N/ha). Since this study shows that AM fungi will likely be an important moderator of plant and ecosystem responses to adverse effects of more variable precipitation, management strategies that bolster AM fungal communities may in turn create systems that are more resilient to these changes.},

Rubisco is a remarkably inefficient enzyme, fixing only 2–10 CO 2 molecules per second. Efforts to increase crop yields by bioengineering Rubisco remain unsuccessful, owing in part to the complex cellular machinery required for Rubisco biogenesis and metabolic maintenance. The large subunit of Rubisco requires the chaperonin system for folding, and recent studies have shown that assembly of hexadecameric Rubisco is mediated by specific assembly chaperones. Moreover, Rubisco function can be inhibited by a range of sugar-phosphate ligands, including RuBP. Metabolic repair depends on remodeling of Rubisco by the ATP-dependent Rubisco activase and hydrolysis of inhibitory sugar phosphates by specific phosphatases. Here, we review our present understanding of the structure and function of these auxiliary factors and their utilization in efforts to engineer more catalytically efficient Rubisco enzymes.},

N was added at three different rates: 0, 5.44, and 27.2 g N m2 y1 . In both studies, Schizachyrium scoparium was the dominant plant species before N treatments were applied. Soil microbial communities from each experiment were characterized using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Discriminant analysis of the FAMEs separated the three N fertilizer treatments in both experiments, indicating shifts in the composition of the microbial communities. In general, plots that received N fertilizer at low or high application rates for 18 years showed increased proportions of bacterial FAMEs and decreased fungal FAMEs. In particular, control plots contained a significantly higher proportion of fungal FAMEs C18:1(cis9) and C18:2(cis9,12) and of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) FAME, C16:1(cis11), than both of the N addition treatment plots. A significant negative effect of N fertilization on the AMF FAME, C16:1(cis11), was measured in the short-term experiment. Our results indicate that high rates of anthropogenic N deposition can lead to significant changes in the composition of soil microbial communities over short periods and can even disrupt the relationship between AMF and plants.},

@article{Bubier2011,
abstract = {Plants in nutrient-poor environments typically have low foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations, long-lived tissues with leaf traits designed to use nutrients efficiently, and low rates of photosynthesis. We postulated that increasing N availability due to atmospheric deposition would increase photosynthetic capacity, foliar N, and specific leaf area (SLA) of bog shrubs. We measured photosynthesis, foliar chemistry and leaf morphology in three ericaceous shrubs (Vaccinium myrtilloides, Ledum groenlandicum and Chamaedaphne calyculata) in a long-term fertilization experiment at Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada, with a background deposition of 0.8 g N m-2 a-1. While biomass and chlorophyll concentrations increased in the highest nutrient treatment for C. calyculata, we found no change in the rates of light-saturated photosynthesis (Amax), carboxylation (Vcmax), or SLA with nutrient (N with and without PK) addition, with the exception of a weak positive correlation between foliar N and Amax for C. calyculata, and higher Vcmax in L. groenlandicum with low nutrient addition. We found negative correlations between photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) and foliar N, accompanied by a species-specific increase in one or more amino acids, which may be a sign of excess N availability and/or a mechanism to reduce ammonium (NH4) toxicity. We also observed a decrease in foliar soluble Ca and Mg concentrations, essential minerals for plant growth, but no change in polyamines, indicators of physiological stress under conditions of high N accumulation. These results suggest that plants adapted to low-nutrient environments do not shift their resource allocation to photosynthetic processes, even after reaching N sufficiency, but instead store the excess N in organic compounds for future use. In the long term, bog species may not be able to take advantage of elevated nutrients, resulting in them being replaced by species that are better adapted to a higher nutrient environment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Measured profiles of photosynthetic capacity in plant crowns typically do not match those of average irradiance: the ratio of capacity to irradiance decreases as irradiance increases. This differs from optimal profiles inferred from simple models. To determine whether this could be explained by omission of physiological or physical details from such models, we performed a series of thought experiments using a new model that included more realism than previous models. We used ray-tracing to simulate irradiance for 8000 leaves in a horizontally uniform canopy. For a subsample of 500 leaves, we simultaneously optimized both nitrogen allocation (among pools representing carboxylation, electron transport and light capture) and stomatal conductance using a transdermally explicit photosynthesis model. Few model features caused the capacity/irradiance ratio to vary systematically with irradiance. However, when leaf absorptance varied as needed to optimize distribution of light-capture N, the capacity/irradiance ratio increased up through the crown - that is, opposite to the observed pattern. This tendency was counteracted by constraints on stomatal or mesophyll conductance, which caused chloroplastic CO2 concentration to decline systematically with increasing irradiance. Our results suggest that height-related constraints on stomatal conductance can help to reconcile observations with the hypothesis that photosynthetic N is allocated optimally. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {American beech (Fagus grandifolia) in the eastern United States and Canada has experienced more than a century of mortality under a steady expansion of disease agents collectively causing beech bark disease (BBD). In North America, BBD consists of insect (e.g., Cryptococcus fagisuga [beech scale] and Xylococculus betulae) and phytopathogenic fungal (Neonectria faginata and N. ditissima) components that can variously interact with host and environment to cause extensive aboveground mortality of beech (i.e., killing front stage). This heavy mortality causes cascading impacts on forest ecosystems, resulting in altered biotic and abiotic conditions in which BBD-inducted mortality persists at reduced levels (i.e., aftermath stage). New evidence suggests that in aftermath conditions, disease agents interact with each other and their environment in ways neither observed nor anticipated from earlier studies of initial disease onset. Previously unrecognized factors such as atmospheric pollution and nutrient imbalances may exacerbate tree susceptibility to this disease. A clearer understanding of BBD-related organisms and their behavior, disease progression and impacts, and interactions between biotic and abiotic factors is needed to support the development of management options aimed at ameliorating economic and ecological consequences of disease-induced forest change. We comprehensively review over a century of literature in order to clarify these aspects in forests newly- and chronically-affected by BBD. Furthermore, we discuss new concerns of a reemergence of heavy mortality in some aftermath forests and present critical knowledge gaps and key considerations to help inform future BBD research and management programs.},

We then turn our attention to the allocation of resources (specifically N and C) in planta, with an emphasis on the secondary metabolites involved in plant defence against herbivores. In doing so, we seek to encourage a more integrated approach to investigation of all aspects of plant responses to eCO2.},

CATISSOL-01) grown in the greenhouse under natural photoperiod. The sunflower plants were grown in vermiculite under two contrasting nitrogen supply, with nitrogen supplied as ammonium nitrate. Higher nitrogen concentration resulted in higher shoot dry matter production per plant and the effect was apparent from 29 days after sowing (DAS). The difference in dry matter production was mainly attributed to the effect of nitrogen on leaf production and on individual leaf dry matter. The specific leaf weight (SLW) was not affected by the nitrogen supply. The photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A) of the target leaves was remarkably improved by high nitrogen nutrition. However, irrespective of nitrogen supply, the decline in photosynthetic CO2 assimilation occurred before the end of leaf growth. Although nitrogen did not change significantly stomatal conductance (gs), high-N grown plants had lower intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) when compared with low-N grown plants. Transpiration rate (E) was increased in high-N grown plants only at the beginning of leaf growth. However, this not resulted in lower intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE). {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nutrient availability is an important factor in crop production, and regular addition of chemical fertilizers is the most common practice to improve yield in agrosystems for intensive crop production. The use of some groups of microorganisms that have specific activity providing nutrients to plants is a good alternative, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance plant nutrition by providing especially phosphorus, improving plant growth and increasing crop production. Unfortunately, the use of AMF as an inoculant on a large scale is not yet widely used, because of several limitations in obtaining a large amount of inoculum due to several factors, such as low growth, the few species of AMF domesticated under in vitro conditions, and high competition with native AMF. The objective of this work was to test the infectivity of a Rhizophagus clarus inoculum and its effectiveness as an alternative for nutrient supply in soybean (Glycine max L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) when compared with conventional chemical fertilization under field conditions. The experiments were carried out in a completely randomized block design with five treatments: Fertilizer, AMF, AMF with Fertilizer, AMF with 1/2 Fertilizer, and the Control with non-inoculated and non-fertilized plants. The parameters evaluated were AMF root colonization and effect of inoculation on plant growth, nutrient absorption and yield. The results showed that AMF inoculation increased around 20 % of root colonization in both soybean and cotton; nutrients analyses in vegetal tissues showed increase of P and nitrogen content in inoculated plants, these results reflect in a higher yield. Our results showed that, AMF inoculation increase the effectiveness of fertilizer application in soybean and reduce the fertilizer dosage in cotton.},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotope ratios ($\delta$13C) of terrestrial plants are employed across a diverse range of applications in environmental and plant sciences; however, the kind of information that is desired from the $\delta$13C signal often differs. At the extremes, it ranges between purely environmental and purely biological. Here, we review environmental drivers of variation in carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$) in terrestrial plants, and the biological processes that can either damp or amplify the response. For C3 plants, where $\Delta$ is primarily controlled by the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentrations (ci/ca), coordination between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis and leaf area adjustment tends to constrain the potential environmentally driven range of $\Delta$. For C4 plants, variation in bundle-sheath leakiness to CO2 can either damp or amplify the effects of ci/ca on $\Delta$. For plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), $\Delta$ varies over a relatively large range as a function of the proportion of daytime to night-time CO2 fixation. This range can be substantially broadened by environmental effects on $\Delta$ when carbon uptake takes place primarily during the day. The effective use of $\Delta$ across its full range of applications will require a holistic view of the interplay between environmental control and physiological modulation of the environmental signal. {\textcopyright} 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Human activities are causing widespread changes in the species composition of natural and managed ecosystems, but the consequences of these changes are poorly understood. This paper presents a conceptual framework for predicting the ecosystem and regional consequences of changes in plant species composition. Changes in species composition have greatest ecological effects when they modify the ecological factors that directly control (and respond to) ecosystem processes. These interactive controls include: functional types of organisms present in the ecosystem; soil resources used by organisms to grow and reproduce; modulators such as microclimate that influence the activity of organisms; disturbance regime; and human activities. Plant traits related to size and growth rate are particularly important because they determine the productive capacity of vegetation and the rates of decomposition and nitrogen mineralization. Because the same plant traits affect most key processes in the cycling of carbon and nutrients, changes in plant traits tend to affect most biogeochemical cycling processes in parallel. Plant traits also have landscape and regional effects through their effects on water and energy exchange and disturbance regime. {\textcopyright} 2003 Annals of Botany Company.},

We explored linkages between the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees and microbial functioning in three hardwood forests in southern Indiana, USA. Across each site's ‘mycorrhizal gradient', we measured fungal biomass, fungal : bacterial (F : B) ratios, extracellular enzyme activities, soil carbon : nitrogen ratio, and soil pH over a growing season. We show that the percentage of AM or ECM trees in a plot promotes microbial communities that both reflect and determine the C to nutrient balance in soil. Soils dominated by ECM trees had higher F : B ratios and more standing fungal biomass than AM stands. Enzyme stoichiometry in ECM soils shifted to higher investment in extracellular enzymes needed for nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition than in C-acquisition enzymes, relative to AM soils. Our results suggest that knowledge of mycorrhizal dominance at the stand or landscape scale may provide a unifying framework for linking plant and microbial community dynamics, and predicting their effects on ecological function.},

abstract = {To fully understand how soil respiration is partitioned among its component fluxes and responds to climate, it is essential to relate it to belowground carbon allocation, the ultimate carbon source for soil respiration. This remains one of the largest gaps in knowledge of terrestrial carbon cycling. Here, we synthesize data on gross and net primary production and their components, and soil respiration and its components, from a global forest database, to determine mechanisms governing belowground carbon allocation and their relationship with soil respiration partitioning and soil respiration responses to climatic factors across global forest ecosystems. Our results revealed that there are three independent mechanisms controlling belowground carbon allocation and which influence soil respiration and its partitioning: an allometric constraint ; a fine-root production vs. root respiration trade-off; and an above- vs. belowground trade-off in plant carbon. Global patterns in soil respiration and its partitioning are constrained primarily by the allometric allocation, which explains some of the previously ambiguous results reported in the literature. Responses of soil respiration and its components to mean annual temperature, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition can be mediated by changes in belowground carbon allocation. Soil respiration responds to mean annual temperature overwhelmingly through an increasing belowground carbon input as a result of extending total day length of growing season, but not by temperature-driven acceleration of soil carbon decomposition, which argues against the possibility of a strong positive feedback between global warming and soil carbon loss. Different nitrogen loads can trigger distinct belowground carbon allocation mechanisms, which are responsible for different responses of soil respiration to nitrogen addition that have been observed. These results provide new insights into belowground carbon allocation, partitioning of soil respiration, and its responses to climate in forest ecosystems and are, therefore, valuable for terrestrial carbon simulations and projections. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

It also suggests that a different element will become the main limiting factor when N saturation has been reached. Although this hypothesis has been tested in temperate forests, whether they can be directly applied to N-saturated tropical forests remain poorly addressed. 2. To test this hypothesis, soil inorganic N, soil N mineralization and nitrification rate, soil N 2 O emission rate and nitrate (NO3 ) leaching rate were measured in an N-saturated old-growth tropical forest in southern China, after 6 years of N and P addition. We hypothesized that N addition would stimulate further N saturation, but P addition might alleviate N saturation. 3. As expected, our results showed that six continuous years of experimental N addition did cause further N saturation, which was indicated by significant increases in soil inorganic N concentration, N 2 O emission and nitrate (NO3 ) leaching. However, in contrast to our expecta- tions, N addition significantly decreased in situ rates of net N mineralization and nitrification, which could be related to associated changes in enzyme activity and microbial community composition. On the other hand, P addition mitigated N saturation, as expected. Soil inorganic N concentration, N2 O emission and NO3 leaching decreased significantly after P addition, but the net rates of N mineralization and nitrification were significantly increased. 4. Our results provide a new understanding of the N saturation hypothesis, suggesting that the effects of long-term N deposition on net N mineralization and nitrification rates in N-saturated tropical forests can be negative and that P addition can alleviate N saturation in such tropical systems.},

abstract = {It has long been observed that leaf nitrogen concentrations decline with depth in closed canopies in a number of plant communities. This phenomenon is gen- erally believed to be related to a changing radiation environment and it has been suggested by some re- searchers that plants allocate nitrogen in order to optimize total whole canopy photosynthesis. Although optimiza- tion theory has been successfully utilized to describe a variety of physiological and ecological phenomena, it has some shortcomings that are subject to criticism (e.g., time constraints, oversimplifications, lack of insights, etc.). In this paper we present an alternative to the optimization theory of plant canopy nitrogen distribution, which we term coordination theory. We hypothesize that plants allocate nitrogen to maintain a balance between two processes, each of which is dependent on leaf nitrogen content and each of which potentially limits photosyn- thesis. These two processes are defined as Wo the Rubisco- limited rate of carboxylation, and Wj, the electron trans- port-limited rate of carboxylation. We suggest that plants allocate nitrogen differentially to leaves in different canopy layers in such a way that W c and Wj remain roughly balanced. In this scheme, the driving force for the allo- cation of nitrogen within a canopy is the difference be- tween the leaf nitrogen content that is required to bring Wc and Wj into balance and the current nitrogen content. We show that the daily carbon assimilation of a canopy with a nitrogen distribution resulting from this internal co- ordination of Wc and Wj is very similar to that obtained using optimization theory.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis by leaves and acquisition of water and minerals by roots are required for plant growth, which is a key component of many ecosystem functions. Although the role of leaf functional traits in photosynthesis is generally well understood, the relationship of root functional traits to nutrient uptake is not. In particular, predictions of nutrient acquisition strategies from specific root traits are often vague. Roots of nearly all plants cooperate with mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient acquisition. Most tree species form symbioses with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Nutrients are distributed heterogeneously in the soil, and nutrient-rich “hotspots” can be a key source for plants. Thus, predicting the foraging strategies that enable mycorrhizal root systems to exploit these hotspots can be critical to the understanding of plant nutrition and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Here, we show that in 13 sympatric temperate tree species, when nutrient availability is patchy, thinner root species alter their foraging to exploit patches, whereas thicker root species do not. Moreover, there appear to be two distinct pathways by which thinner root tree species enhance foraging in nutrient-rich patches: AM trees produce more roots, whereas EM trees produce more mycorrhizal fungal hyphae. Our results indicate that strategies of nutrient foraging are complementary among tree species with contrasting mycorrhiza types and root morphologies, and that predictable relationships between below-ground traits and nutrient acquisition emerge only when both roots and mycorrhizal fungi are considered together.},

abstract = {Plant roots and the associated mycorrhizal fungal hyphae often selectively proliferate into patchily distributed soil nutrient hotspots, but interactions between these two components of a mycorrhizal root system are usually ignored or experimentally isolated in nutrient foraging studies. From studies in which both roots and mycorrhizal hyphae had access to nutrient hotspots, we compiled data on root foraging precision (increase in roots in nutrient hotspots relative to outside hotspots) of plant species from different ecosystems, ranging from temperate grasslands to subtropical forests. We found that root foraging precision across the wide range of plant species was strongly influenced by root morphology and mycorrhizal type. The precision of root nutrient foraging, as a plant functional trait, may coordinate with other root traits that are related to the economics of nutrient acquisition. High foraging precision is expected to associate with the strategy of fast return on the investment in roots, such as low construction cost, high metabolic rate and rapid turnover. Nutrient foraging by mycorrhizal fungi alone may be influenced by functional traits such as hyphal exploration distance, hyphal turnover, and hyphal uptake capacity and efficiency, but such data are limited to a small portion of mycorrhizal fungal species. We propose a conceptual framework in which to simulate nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition from both nutrient hotspots and outside hotspots in mixed-species plant communities. Simulation outputs suggest that plant species with varying root morphology and mycorrhizal type can be adaptive to a range of nutrient heterogeneity. Although there are still knowledge gaps related to nutrient foraging, as well as many unexplored plant and fungal species, we suggest that scaling nutrient foraging from individual plants to communities would advance understanding of plant species interactions and below-ground ecosystem function.

abstract = {Abstract. The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) is a process-based model that simulates the fluxes of carbon, water, energy and momentum between the land surface and the atmosphere. Many studies have demonstrated the important role of the land surface in the functioning of the Earth System. Different versions of JULES have been employed to quantify the effects on the land carbon sink of climate change, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, changing atmospheric aerosols and tropospheric ozone, and the response of methane emissions from wetlands to climate change. This paper describes the consolidation of these advances in the modelling of carbon fluxes and stores, in both the vegetation and soil, in version 2.2 of JULES. Features include a multi-layer canopy scheme for light interception, including a sunfleck penetration scheme, a coupled scheme of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, representation of the effects of ozone on leaf physiology, and a description of methane emissions from wetlands. JULES represents the carbon allocation, growth and population dynamics of five plant functional types. The turnover of carbon from living plant tissues is fed into a 4-pool soil carbon model. The process-based descriptions of key ecological processes and trace gas fluxes in JULES mean that this community model is well-suited for use in carbon cycle, climate change and impacts studies, either in standalone mode or as the land component of a coupled Earth system model.},

abstract = {Global change is altering species distributions and thus interactions among organisms. Organisms live in concert with thousands of other species, some beneficial, some pathogenic, some which have little to no effect in complex communities. Since natural communities are composed of organisms with very different life history traits and dispersal ability it is unlikely they will all respond to climatic change in a similar way. Disjuncts in plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions under global change have been relatively well described, but plant-soil microorganism and soil microbe-microbe relationships have received less attention. Since soil microorganisms regulate nutrient transformations, provide plants with nutrients, allow co-existence among neighbors, and control plant populations, changes in soil microorganism-plant interactions could have significant ramifications for plant community composition and ecosystem function. In this paper we explore how climatic change affects soil microbes and soil microbe-plant interactions directly and indirectly, discuss what we see as emerging and exciting questions and areas for future research, and discuss what ramifications changes in these interactions may have on the composition and function of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Aim: Within C 3 plants, photosynthesis is a balance between CO2 supply from the atmosphere via stomata and demand by enzymes within chloroplasts. This process is dynamic and a complex but crucial aspect of photosynthesis. We sought to under‐ stand the spatial pattern in CO2 supply–demand balance on a global scale, via analysis of stable isotopes of carbon within leaves ($\Delta$13 C), which provide an integra‐ tive record of CO2 drawdown during photosynthesis. Location: Global. Time period: 1951–2011. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants. Methods: We assembled a database of leaf carbon isotope ratios containing 3,979 species–site combinations from across the globe, including 3,645 for C 3 species. We examined a wide array of potential climate and soil drivers of variation in $\Delta$13 C. Results: The strongest drivers of carbon isotope discrimination at the global scale included atmospheric pressure, potential evapotranspiration and soil pH, which ex‐ plained 44% of the variation in $\Delta$13 C. Addition of eight more climate and soil variables (each explaining small but highly significant amounts of variation) increased the ex‐ plained variation to 60%. On top of this, the largest plant trait effect was leaf nitrogen per area, which explained 11% of $\Delta$13 C variation. Main conclusions: By considering variation in $\Delta$13 C at a considerably larger scale than previously, we were able to identify and quantify key drivers in CO2 supply–demand balance previously unacknowledged. Of special note is the key role of soil properties, with greater discrimination on low‐pH and high‐silt soils. Unlike other plant traits, which show typically wide variation within sets of coexisting species, the global pattern in carbon stable isotope ratios is much more conservative; there is relatively narrow variation in time‐integrated CO2 concentrations at the site of carboxylation among plants in a given soil and climate.},

We tested three hypotheses by which ectomycorrhizas might facilitate the dominance of the tree, Oreomunnea mexicana, in montane tropical forest in Panama. We tested whether access to ectomycorrhizal networks improved growth and survival of seedlings, evaluated whether ectomycorrhizal fungi promote seedling growth via positive plant–soil feedback, and measured whether Oreomunnea reduced inor- ganic nitrogen availability. We found no evidence that Oreomunnea benefits from ectomycorrhizal networks or plant–soil feedback. However, we found three-fold higher soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations outside than inside Oreomunnea-dominated forest and a correlation between soil nitrate and Oreomunnea abundance in plots. Ectomycorrhizal effects on nitrogen cycling might therefore provide an explanation for the monodominance of ectomycorrhizal tree species world- wide.},

abstract = {Mycorrhizal benefit to plants is most frequently evaluated through growth differences between mycorrhizal (M) and non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants. These growth differences are often considered to be due to differences in belowground C expenditure, or in cost efficiency, i.e. amount of nutrients acquired per C expended. We searched published reports for relations between plant growth and belowground C allocation, C use efficiency, or nutrient uptake, in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) versus non-mycorrhizal plants. We found a similar number of cases of negative, null or positive effects of ECM on plant growth. These effects were not correlated with differences on belowground C allocation or C use efficiency between M and NM plants. In contrast, they were very strongly correlated with mycorrhizal effects on plant N gain. A comprehensive analysis of the published data therefore provided evidence that C is an excess, rather than a costly, resource, and that the outcome of the symbiosis depends only on whether mycorrhizae result in increased or decreased nutrient acquisition compared with NM plants, and not on cost efficiency differences between M and NM plants. Consequences of this finding for the regulation of resource exchange between symbionts and the nature of the symbiosis are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Pinus pinaster seedlings were inoculated with living or dead (control) cultures of Pisolithus tinctorius, supplied with ammonium at 4 (limiting) or 7% d−1 (non-limiting) N relative addition rate (RARN ), and followed development for 29 days. Mycorrhizal colonization of roots was quantified by the determination of ergosterol. A series of enzymes (sucrose and trehalose metabolism, anaplerosis) and metabolites (soluble carbohydrate, including trehalose; fructose 2,6 bisphosphate, free amino acids) relevant in the C/N exchange between symbionts, and in the carbon allocation and sink strength within the plant were assayed for 2-day-intervals for up to 14 days, and at 5-day-intervals for the rest of the experiment. The first 10 days reflected the establishment of mycorrhizal interaction, and the carbon allocation to the root was higher in M plants independent of N supply. Following this period, carbon allocation became N-related, higher at low, and lower at high N supply. The belowground C investment of M plants was dependent on N availability, but not on N gain. Finally, increased below- ground C allocation was accompanied by a shift from plant to fungal metabolism.},

abstract = {In the present work, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) the negative effects of mycorrhization over host plant productivity in N-limited conditions are due to N retention by the fungal partner and not due to excessive C drainage; (2) If mycorrhization results in decreased N uptake, the host plant decreases its C investment in fungal growth. The effects of mycorrhization over a wide range of combinations between N availability, N concentration in plant tissues, and degree of mycorrhizal colonization were studied in Pinus pinaster L. mycorrhizal with Pisolithus tinctorius. Several plant productivity parameters, the seed- lings' N status, chl a fluorescence (JIP test), and mycorrhi- zal colonization were measured. N was always limiting. A gradient of mycorrhizal effects over the host plant's growth and vitality was successfully obtained. The mycorrhizal effects on plant growth and N uptake were very strongly and positively correlated, and no evidence was found of a C limitation to growth, confirming hypothesis 1. Indications were found that the plants continued to provide C to the fungus although the N supplied by it was increasingly lower, denying hypothesis 2. A new index, the mycorrhizal N demand–supply balance, was found to efficiently explain, and to have a curvilinear relation with, the variation in response to mycorrhization. The mycorrhizal effect on host plant growth was not related to a negative effect on its photosynthetic performance and, therefore, reflected changes in resource allocation between host plant and mycorrhizal fungus, not in plant vitality.},

@article{Cowden2009,
abstract = {We present a cellular automaton that simulates the interaction between a host tree and multiple potential mycorrhizal symbionts and generates testable hypotheses of how processes at the scale of individual root tips may explain mycorrhizal community composition. Existing theoretical biological market models imply that a single host is able to interact with and select from multiple symbionts to organize an optimal symbiont community. When evaluating the tree–symbiont interaction, two scales must be considered simultaneously: the scale of the entire host plant at which carbon utilization and nutrient demands operate, and the scale of the individual root tip, at which colonization and carbon-nutrient trade occurs. Three strategies that may be employed by the host tree for optimizing carbon use and nutrient acquisition through mycorrhizal symbiont communities are simulated: (1) carbon pool adjustment, in which the plant controls only the total amount of carbon to be distributed uniformly throughout the root system, (2) symbiont selection, wherein the plant opts either for or against the interaction at each fine root tip, and (3) selective carbon allocation, wherein the plant adjusts the amount of carbon allocated to each root tip based on the cost of nutrients. Strategies were tested over various nutrient availabilities (the amount of inorganically and organically bound nutrients). Success was defined on the basis of minimizing carbon expended for nutrient acquisition because this would allow more carbon to be utilized for growth and reproduction. In all cases, the symbiont selection and selective carbon allocation strategies were able to meet the nutritional requirements of the plant, but did not necessarily optimize carbon use. The carbon pool adjustment strategy is the only strategy that does not operate at the individual root tip scale, and the strategy was not successful when inorganic nutrients were scarce since there is no mechanism to exclude suboptimal symbionts. The combination of the symbiont selection strategy and the carbon pool adjustment resulted in optimal carbon use and nutrient acquisition under all environmental conditions but result in monospecific symbiont assemblages. On the other hand, the selective carbon allocation strategy is the only strategy that maintained successful, multi-symbiont communities. The simulations presented here thus imply clear hypotheses about the effect of nutrient availability on symbiont selection and mycorrhizal community richness and composition.},

abstract = {Ratios of nitrogen (N) isotopes in leaves could elucidate underlying patterns of N cycling across ecological gradients. To better understand global-scale patterns of N cycling, we compiled data on foliar N isotope ratios (delta N-15), foliar N concentrations, mycorrhizal type and climate for over 11 000 plants worldwide. Arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal, and ericoid mycorrhizal plants were depleted in foliar delta N-15 by 2 parts per thousand, 3.2 parts per thousand, 5.9 parts per thousand, respectively, relative to nonmycorrhizal plants. Foliar delta N-15 increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation and with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) across sites with MAT >= -0.5 degrees C, but was invariant with MAT across sites with MAT < -0.5 degrees C. In independent landscape-level to regional-level studies, foliar delta N-15 increased with increasing N availability; at the global scale, foliar delta N-15 increased with increasing foliar N concentrations and decreasing foliar phosphorus (P) concentrations. Together, these results suggest that warm, dry ecosystems have the highest N availability, while plants with high N concentrations, on average, occupy sites with higher N availability than plants with low N concentrations. Global-scale comparisons of other components of the N cycle are still required for better mechanistic understanding of the determinants of variation in foliar delta N-15 and ultimately global patterns in N cycling.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2018. Human societies depend on an Earth system that operates within a constrained range of nutrient availability, yet the recent trajectory of terrestrial nitrogen (N) availability is uncertain. Examining patterns of foliar N concentrations and isotope ratios ($\delta$ 15 N) from more than 43,000 samples acquired over 37 years, here we show that foliar N concentration declined by 9% and foliar $\delta$ 15 N declined by 0.6–1.6‰. Examining patterns across different climate spaces, foliar $\delta$ 15 N declined across the entire range of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation tested. These results suggest declines in N supply relative to plant demand at the global scale. In all, there are now multiple lines of evidence of declining N availability in many unfertilized terrestrial ecosystems, including declines in $\delta$ 15 N of tree rings and leaves from herbarium samples over the past 75–150 years. These patterns are consistent with the proposed consequences of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and longer growing seasons. These declines will limit future terrestrial carbon uptake and increase nutritional stress for herbivores.},

abstract = {Microbial communities regulate many belowground carbon cycling processes; thus, the impact of climate change on the structure and function of soil microbial communities could, in turn, impact the release or storage of carbon in soils. Here we used a large-scale precipitation manipulation (+18%, −50%, or ambient) in a pi{\~{n}}on-juniper woodland ( Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma ) to investigate how changes in precipitation amounts altered soil microbial communities as well as what role seasonal variation in rainfall and plant composition played in the microbial community response. Seasonal variability in precipitation had a larger role in determining the composition of soil microbial communities in 2008 than the direct effect of the experimental precipitation treatments. Bacterial and fungal communities in the dry, relatively moisture-limited premonsoon season were compositionally distinct from communities in the monsoon season, when soil moisture levels and periodicity varied more widely across treatments. Fungal abundance in the drought plots during the dry premonsoon season was particularly low and was 4.7 times greater upon soil wet-up in the monsoon season, suggesting that soil fungi were water limited in the driest plots, which may result in a decrease in fungal degradation of carbon substrates. Additionally, we found that both bacterial and fungal communities beneath pi{\~{n}}on pine and juniper were distinct, suggesting that microbial functions beneath these trees are different. We conclude that predicting the response of microbial communities to climate change is highly dependent on seasonal dynamics, background climatic variability, and the composition of the associated aboveground community.},

abstract = {As tree species composition in forests of the northeastern United States changes due to invasive forest pests, climate change, or other stressors, the extent to which forests will retain or release N from atmospheric deposition remains uncertain. We used a species-specific, dynamic forest ecosystem model (Spe-CN) to investigate how nitrate (NO 3 – ) leaching may vary among stands dominated by different species, receiving varied atmospheric N inputs, or undergoing species change due to an invasive forest pest (emerald ash borer; EAB). In model simulations, NO 3 – leaching varied widely among stands dominated by 12 northeastern North American tree species. Nitrate leaching increased with N deposition or forest age, generally with greater magnitude for deciduous (except red oak) than coniferous species. Species with lowest baseline leaching rates (e.g., red spruce, eastern hemlock, red oak) showed threshold responses to N deposition. EAB effects on leaching depended on the species replacing white ash: after 100 years, predicted leaching increased 73% if sugar maple replaced ash but decreased 55% if red oak replaced ash. This analysis suggests that the effects of tree species change on NO 3 – leaching over time may be large and variable and should be incorporated into predictions of effects of N deposition on leaching from forested landscapes.},

abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is altering bio- geochemical cycling in forests and interconnected lakes of the northeastern US, and may shift nutrient limitation from N toward other essential elements, such as phosphorus (P). Whether this shift is occur- ring relative to N deposition gradients across the northeastern US has not been investigated. We used datasets for the northeastern US and the Adirondack sub-region to evaluate whether P limitation is increasing where N deposition is high at two geo- graphic scales, based on N:P mass ratios. Using a model-selection approach, we determined that foliar N for dominant tree species and lake dissolved inor- ganic N (DIN) increased coincident with increasing N deposition, independent of relationships between foliar N or lake DIN and precipitation or temperature. Foliar P also increased with N deposition across the northeastern US for seven of eight deciduous species, but changed less across the Adirondacks. Foliar N:P therefore declined at the highest levels of N deposi- tion for most deciduous species across the region (remaining nearly constant for most conifers and increasing only for black cherry and hemlock), but increased across all species in the Adirondacks. Ratios between DIN and total P (DIN:TP) in lakes were unrelated to N deposition regionally but increased across the Adirondacks. Thus, nutrient limitation patterns shifted from N toward P for dominant trees, and further toward P for predominantly P-limited lakes, at the sub-regional but not regional scale. For the northeastern US overall, accumulated N deposi- tion may be insufficient to drive nutrient limitation from N toward P; alternatively, elements other than P (for example, calcium, magnesium) may become limiting as N accumulates. The consistent Adirondack foliar and lake response could provide early indication of shifts toward P limitation within the north- eastern US, and together with regional patterns, suggests that foliar chemistry could be a predictor of lake chemistry in the context of N deposition across the region.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the spatial and temporal variability of winter droughts in a semi-arid geographic gradient in Northeast Spain, from the Pyrenees in the north to the Mediterranean coastland in the south. Droughts that occurred between 1952 and 1999 were analysed by means of the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The influence of the weather-type frequency and of the general North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns was analysed. The results indicate that winter droughts show an important spatial variability in the study area, differentiating three well-defined patterns. These correspond to the Pyrenees, the centre of the Ebro Valley, and the Mediterranean coastland. General negative trends in winter SPI have been found, which are indicative of the increase in winter drought conditions in the study area. Nevertheless, important spatial differences have also been recorded. Dominant north–south gradients in the influence of weather types are shown. Moreover, the negative trends in winter-SPI values agree with the negative trend in the frequency of the weather types prone to cause precipitation, such as the C, SW and W weather types and the increase in the frequency of A weather types. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean coastland, the positive trend in SPI values agrees with the increase in the frequency of weather types of the east (E, SE), which are prone to cause precipitation in this area. Interannual variations in the frequency of the different weather types have been highly determined by different general atmospheric circulation patterns, mainly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Nevertheless, the correlation between the time series of weather-type frequency and the winter SPI is higher than that found between the SPI and the NAO. Thus, although the interannual NAO variability explains a high percentage of the interannual differences in the frequency of different weather types, it is not sufficient to explain the spatial and temporal variability of droughts, which respond better to atmospheric variability at more detailed (synoptic) spatial scales.},

No correlation was found between d13C and the contents of any mass-based biochemical cons- tituent. Nevertheless there was a signi{\AE}cant correlation between d13 C and leaf mass per area of Q. ilex.

In addition, an evaluation of a pair of CESM2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. CESM2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

However, the amount and global distribution of this fixation is highly disputed. Using a comprehensive meta-analysis of field measurements, we make a new assessment of global biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). We assessed the relationship between BNF in natural terrestrial environments and empirical predictors of BNF commonly used in terrestrial ecosystem and earth system models. We found no evidence for any statistically significant relationship between BNF and evapotranspiration and net or gross primary terrestrial productivity. We assessed the relationship between BNF and 11 other climate variables and soil properties at a global scale. We found that all the variables we considered had little predictive power for BNF. Using averaged biome values upscaled we calculated the median global inputs of BNF in natural ecosystems as 88 Tg N year−1. The range (52–130 Tg N year−1) encompasses most recent estimates and broadly agrees with recent independent top-down estimates of BNF. The global values indicate a significant role for free living, as opposed to symbiotic, BNF, accounting for at least a third of all BNF. This work provides a new global benchmark and spatial distribution data set of BNF using a bottom-up methodology.},

The land sur- face models were run offline with a common spin-up and forcing protocol. We use a historical control simulation and two perturbations to assess the model nitrogen-related per- formances: a simulation with atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by 200 ppm and one with nitrogen deposition in- creased by 50 kgN ha−1 yr−1. There is generally greater vari- ability in productivity response between models to increased nitrogen than to carbon dioxide. Across the five models the response to carbon dioxide globally was 5 % to 20 % and the response to nitrogen was 2 % to 24 %. The models are not evenly distributed within the ensemble range, with two of the models having low productivity response to nitrogen and another one with low response to elevated atmospheric car- bon dioxide, compared to the other models. In all five mod- els individual grid cells tend to exhibit bimodality, with ei- ther a strong response to increased nitrogen or atmospheric carbon dioxide but rarely to both to an equal extent. How- ever, this local effect does not scale to either the regional or global level. The global and tropical responses are gen- erally more accurately modelled than boreal, tundra, or other high-latitude areas compared to observations. These results are due to divergent choices in the representation of key nitrogen cycle processes. They show the need for more obser- vational studies to enhance understanding of nitrogen cycle processes, especially nitrogen-use efficiency and biological nitrogen fixation.},

abstract = {Biological nitrogen fixation is the main source of new nitrogen into natural terrestrial ecosystems and consequently in the nitrogen cycle in many earth system models. Representation of biological nitrogen fixation varies, and because of the tight coupling between the carbon and nitrogen cycles, previous studies have shown that this affects projected changes in net primary productivity. Here we present the first assessment of the performance of biological nitrogen fixation in models contributing to CMIP6 compared to observed and observation-constrained estimates of biological nitrogen fixation. We find that 9 out of 10 models represent global total biological nitrogen fixation within the uncertainty in recent global estimates. However, 6 out of 10 models overestimate the amount of fixation in the tropics and therefore the extent of the latitudinal gradient in the global distribution. For the SSP3-7.0 scenario of future climate change, models project increases in fixation over the 21st century of up to 80%. However, while the historical range of biological nitrogen fixation amongst models is large (up to 140kgNha-1yr-1 at the grid cell level and 43-208TgNyr-1 globally) this does not have explanatory power for variations within the model ensemble of net primary productivity or the coupled nitrogen-carbon cycle. Models with shared structures can have significant variations in both biological nitrogen fixation and other parts of the nitrogen cycle without differing in their net primary productivity. This points to systematic challenges in the representation of carbon-nitrogen model structures and the severe limitations of models using net primary productivity or evapotranspiration to project the biological nitrogen fixation response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide or other environmental changes.},

abstract = {served solar radiation data at three sites in the northeastern United States are compared with values estimated for nearby airport locations using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC) models. A tendency toward considerable overes- timation of relatively low values of observed solar radiation is evident in the NREL model. This bias is apparently regardless of season. A similar bias is not detected in the NRCC model. For moderate to high values of solar radiation both models produce estimates with similar accuracy for most practical applica- tions. However, these models both tend to underestimate observed solar radiation on days when near maximum possible radiation levels are received. The tendency for the NREL model to overestimate low solar radiation values appears to be linked to the use of total sky cover, rather than the combination of cloud coverage and cloud base height information. Although total sky coverage data may be superior for estimates of moderate to high daily solar radiation values, it appears that information regarding the height of low overcast lavers and the presence of obstructions to visibility, such as fog or haze, is required to accurately estimate low daily solar radiation totals},

The increase in CO2 uptake was induced by a sudden increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO 2 ]). Twelve 2-year-old trees were transplanted and grown in perlite-filled pots in a greenhouse. Rates of CO2 uptake and water loss by individual trees were determined by a branch bag method from 3 days be- fore until 6 days after [CO2 ] was increased. Nutrient uptake rates were measured concurrently by a hydroponic recirculat- ing nutrient solution system that provided non-limiting sup- plies of water and nutrients. Six control trees were kept in am- bient [CO2 ] (360 ppm), and [CO2 ] was increased to 550 ppm for one set of three trees and to 800 ppm for another set of three trees. Before imposing the elevated [CO2 ] treatments, all trees exhibited similar daily water loss, CO2 uptake and nutrient up- take rates when expressed per unit leaf area to account for the tree size effect. Daily water loss rates were only slightly af- fected by elevated [CO2 ]. Carbon dioxide uptake rates greatly increased with increasing atmospheric [CO2 ], and nutrient up- take rates were proportional to CO2 uptake rates during the study period, except for P ion. Our results show that, despite the important carbon and nitrogen storage capacities previously observed in young walnut trees, nutrient uptake by roots is strongly coupled to carbon uptake by shoots over periods of a few days},

abstract = {A system of natural reserves, each surrounded by altered habitat, resembles a system of islands from the point of view of species restricted to natural habitats. Recent advances in island biogeography may provide a detailed basis for understanding what to expect of such a system of reserves. The main conclusions are as follows:. The number of species that a reserve can hold at equilibrium is a function of its area and its isolation. Larger reserves, and reserves located close to other reserves, can hold more species. If most of the area of a habitat is destroyed, and a fraction of the area is saved as a reserve, the reserve will initially contain more species than it can hold at equilibrium. The excess will gradually go extinct. The smaller the reserve, the higher will be the extinction rates. Estimates of these extinction rates for bird and mammal species have recently become available in a few cases. Different species require different minimum areas to have a reasonable chance of survival. Some geometric design principles are suggested in order to optimise the function of reserves in saving species. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

abstract = {Regional and global models of the terrestrial biosphere depend critically on models of photosynthesis when predicting impacts of global change. This paper focuses on identifying the primary data needs of these models, what scales drive uncertainty, and how to improve measurements. Overall, there is a need for an open, cross- discipline database on leaf-level photosynthesis in general, and response curves in particular. The parameters in pho- tosynthetic models are not constant through time, space, or canopy position but there is a need for a better under- standing of whether relationships with drivers, such as leaf nitrogen, are themselves scale dependent. Across time scales, as ecosystem models become more sophisticated in their representations of succession they needs to be able to approximate sunfleck responses to capture understory growth and survival. At both high and low latitudes, pho- tosynthetic data are inadequate in general and there is a particular need to better understand thermal acclimation. Simple models of acclimation suggest that shifts in optimal temperature are important. However, there is little advan- tage to synoptic-scale responses and circadian rhythms may be more beneficial than acclimation over shorter timescales. At high latitudes, there is a need for a better understanding of low-temperature photosynthetic limits, while at low latitudes the need is for a better understanding of phosphorus limitations on photosynthesis. In terms of sampling, measuring multivariate photosynthetic response surfaces are potentially more efficient and more accurate than traditional univariate response curves. Finally, there is a need for greater community involvement in model vali- dation and model-data synthesis.},

abstract = {Abstract. Nitrogen content per unit leaf area (Narea) is a key variable in plant functional ecology and biogeochemistry. Narea comprises a structural component, which scales with leaf mass per area (LMA), and a metabolic component, which scales with Rubisco capacity. The co-ordination hypothesis, as implemented in LPJ and related global vegetation models, predicts that Rubisco capacity should be directly proportional to irradiance but should decrease with increases in ci : ca and temperature because the amount of Rubisco required to achieve a given assimilation rate declines with increases in both. We tested these predictions using LMA, leaf $\delta$13C, and leaf N measurements on complete species assemblages sampled at sites on a north–south transect from tropical to temperate Australia. Partial effects of mean canopy irradiance, mean annual temperature, and ci : ca (from $\delta$13C) on Narea were all significant and their directions and magnitudes were in line with predictions. Over 80 % of the variance in community-mean (ln) Narea was accounted for by these predictors plus LMA. Moreover, Narea could be decomposed into two components, one proportional to LMA (slightly steeper in N-fixers), and the other to Rubisco capacity as predicted by the co-ordination hypothesis. Trait gradient analysis revealed ci : ca to be perfectly plastic, while species turnover contributed about half the variation in LMA and Narea. Interest has surged in methods to predict continuous leaf-trait variation from environmental factors, in order to improve ecosystem models. Coupled carbon–nitrogen models require a method to predict Narea that is more realistic than the widespread assumptions that Narea is proportional to photosynthetic capacity, and/or that Narea (and photosynthetic capacity) are determined by N supply from the soil. Our results indicate that Narea has a useful degree of predictability, from a combination of LMA and ci : ca – themselves in part environmentally determined – with Rubisco activity, as predicted from local growing conditions. This finding is consistent with a plant-centred approach to modelling, emphasizing the adaptive regulation of traits. Models that account for biodiversity will also need to partition community-level trait variation into components due to phenotypic plasticity and/or genotypic differentiation within species vs. progressive species replacement, along environmental gradients. Our analysis suggests that variation in Narea is about evenly split between these two modes.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) limitation has been considered as a constraint on terrestrial carbon uptake in response to rising CO 2 and climate change. By extension, it has been suggested that declining carboxylation capacity (V cmax) and leaf N content in enhanced-CO 2 experiments and satellite records signify increasing N limitation of primary production. We predicted V cmax using the coordination hypothesis, and estimated changes in leaf-level photosynthetic N for 1982-2016 assuming proportionality with leaf-level V cmax at 25˚C. Whole-canopy photosynthetic N was derived using satellite-based leaf area index (LAI) data and an empirical extinction coefficient for V cmax , and converted to annual N demand using estimated leaf turnover times. The predicted spatial pattern of V cmax shares key features with an independent reconstruction from remotely-sensed leaf chlorophyll content. Predicted leaf photosynthetic N declined by 0.27 \% yr-1 , while observed leaf (total) N declined by 0.2-0.25 \% yr-1. Predicted global canopy N (and N demand) declined from 1996 onwards, despite increasing LAI. Leaf-level responses to rising CO 2 , and to a lesser extent temperature, may have reduced the canopy requirement for N by more than rising LAI has increased it. This finding provides an alternative explanation for declining leaf N that does not depend on increasing N limitation.},

abstract = { Leaf nitrogen concentration often is higher in leguminous plants, which associate with dini- trogen-fixing bacteria, compared with nonlegume plants. However, the range of nitrogen concentrations in legumes is wide, likely related to the range of nitrogen fixation strategies. We evaluated how carbon and nitrogen allocation to roots, stems and leaves is influenced by the type of strategy of nitrogen fixation regulation.  We grew herbaceous annual legumes (Medicago truncatula, Hymenocarpos circinnatus and Vicia palaestina) under two nitrogen availability treatments (none/sufficient), with and without bacterial inoculation.  We found facultative downregulation of the rate of nitrogen fixation when nitrogen was available in H. circinnatus, and an obligate similar fixation rate in both nitrogen treatments in M. truncatula and V. palaestina. Uninoculated plants invested more biomass in roots and con- tained lower nitrogen concentrations. However, nitrogen concentration in the entire plant and in the leaves was lower and more plastic in the species with a facultative fixation strategy, whereas species with an obligate fixation strategy also maintained high nitrogen concentra- tions.  Our results suggest a suite of functional traits associated with the strategies of allocation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. This suite of traits probably shapes successional and func- tional niches of different leguminous species in specious plant communities.},

abstract = {1. The importance of symbiotic dinitrogen (N2) fixation in shaping the coupled nitro- gen–carbon cycle is now known for most humid terrestrial ecosystems. However, whether N2 fixation can play a key role in the nitrogen and carbon budget of water-limited and seasonally dry ecosystems remains a mystery. 2. The maintenance of metabolically and physiologically costly symbiotic fixation in water-limited environments is highly complex. These costs are particularly high dur- ing the first developmental season, when allocation to deep rooting and drought re- sistance mechanisms is essential for seedling survival of prolonged seasonal drought. 3. We, therefore, evaluated how drought-adapted legume species change their alloca- tion to symbiotic nitrogen fixation as a function of soil nitrogen availability. We tested this on seedlings of a suite of four common Mediterranean legume shrubs with a strong seasonal behaviour, which we grew under controlled nitrogen and phospho- rus availabilities. We asked: (1) Do species differ in their investment and regulation of nitrogen fixation? (2) Is fixation regulated via plant allocation to nodules, fixation rate or both? and (3) Does phosphorus availability limit symbiotic nitrogen fixation? 4. All Mediterranean perennial legumes in the experiment established and grew, nodu- lated, and fixed nitrogen, even under severe nitrogen limitation. The four species reacted similarly to nitrogen supply, by strongly downregulating fixation through both decreased nodulation and lower rate of fixation. However, we found a signifi- cant interspecific difference in fixation (both nodulation and rate), biomass produc- tion and growth rate. Our experimental species presented a range of fixation investment strategies corresponding to life-history and resource partitioning pat- terns. Phosphorus limitation had a minor influence on both fixation and plant growth. 5. Synthesis. The high physiological cost of symbiotic fixation imposes the need to tightly regulate fixation in perennial legumes coping with severe water stress. Control of fixation allows legume species to colonize recently disturbed nitrogen- deficient habitats, cope with grazing, survive long seasonal droughts and recover nitrogen fixation later in the wet season, and survive over time by reducing nitro- gen inputs to the ecosystem.},

abstract = {(Table presented.). Summary: Plant carbon metabolism is impacted by rising CO2 concentrations and temperatures, but also feeds back onto the climate system to help determine the trajectory of future climate change. Here we review how photosynthesis, photorespiration and respiration are affected by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate warming, both separately and in combination. We also compile data from the literature on plants grown at multiple temperatures, focusing on net CO2 assimilation rates and leaf dark respiration rates measured at the growth temperature (Agrowth and Rgrowth, respectively). Our analyses show that the ratio of Agrowth to Rgrowth is generally homeostatic across a wide range of species and growth temperatures, and that species that have reduced Agrowth at higher growth temperatures also tend to have reduced Rgrowth, while species that show stimulations in Agrowth under warming tend to have higher Rgrowth in the hotter environment. These results highlight the need to study these physiological processes together to better predict how vegetation carbon metabolism will respond to climate change.},

abstract = {Decades of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in the northeastern USA have enhanced this globally important forest carbon (C) sink by relieving N limitation. While many N fertilization experiments found increased forest C storage, the mechanisms driving this response at the ecosystem scale remain uncertain. Following the optimal allocation theory, augmented N availability may reduce belowground C investment by trees to roots and soil symbionts. To test this prediction and its implications on soil biogeochemistry, we constructed C and N budgets for a long-term, whole-watershed N fertilization study at the Fernow Experimental Forest, WV, USA. Nitrogen fertilization increased C storage by shifting C partitioning away from belowground components and towards aboveground woody biomass production. Fertilization also reduced the C cost of N acquisition, allowing for greater C sequestration in vegetation. Despite equal fine litter inputs, the C and N stocks and C : N ratio of the upper mineral soil were greater in the fertilized watershed, likely due to reduced decomposition of plant litter. By combining aboveground and belowground data at the watershed scale, this study demonstrates how plant C allocation responses to N additions may result in greater C storage in both vegetation and soil.},

abstract = {The magnitude of changes in carboxylation capacity in dominant plant species under long-term elevated CO2 exposure (elevated pC a) directly impacts ecosystem CO2 assimilation from the atmosphere. We analyzed field CO2 response curves of 16 C3 species of different plant growth forms in favorable growth conditions in four free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments in a pine and deciduous forest, a grassland and a desert. Among species and across herb, tree and shrub growth forms there were significant enhancements in CO2 assimilation (A) by + 40 ± 5% in elevated pCa (49.5-57.1Pa), although there were also significant reductions in photosynthetic capacity in elevated pCa in some species. Photosynthesis at a common pCa (Aa) was significantly reduced in five species growing under elevated pC a, while leaf carboxylation capacity (Vcmax) was significantly reduced by elevated pCa in seven species (change of -19 ±3% among these species) across different growth forms and FACE sites. Adjustments in Vcmax with elevated pC a were associated with changes in leaf N among species, and occurred in species with the highest leaf N. Elevated pCa treatment did not affect the mass-based relationships between A or V cmax and N, which differed among herbs, trees and shrubs. Thus, effects of elevated pCa on leaf C assimilation and carboxylation capacity occurred largely through changes in leaf N, rather than through elevated pCa effects on the relationships themselves. Maintenance of leaf carboxylation capacity among species in elevated pCa at these sites depends on maintenance of canopy N stocks, with leaf N depletion associated with photosynthetic capacity adjustments. Since CO2 responses can only be measured experimentally on a small number of species, understanding elevated CO 2 effects on canopy Nm and Na will greatly contribute to an ability to model responses of leaf photosynthesis to atmospheric CO2 in different species and plant growth forms. {\textcopyright} 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Thus, it is essential to understand how photosynthetic production across diverse ecosystems is, or is not, limited by N and P. Via a large-scale meta-analysis of experimental enrichments, we show that P limitation is equally strong across these major habitats and that N and P limitation are equivalent within both terrestrial and freshwater systems. Furthermore, simultaneous N and P enrichment produces strongly positive synergistic responses in all three environments. Thus, contrary to some prevailing paradigms, freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems are surprisingly similar in terms of N and P limitation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Climate change and invasions by non-native organisms are two factors of global change likely to alter the structure and function of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. We conducted a large-scale field experiment to determine how changes in amount of summer precipitation and invasions by an African grass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) may interact with soil texture to affect community and ecosystem processes in temperate grasslands and savannas of southern Arizona, USA. In particular, we investigated the response of soil moisture at several soil depths within seventy-two 2.7 m2 plots under six 9 m×18 m rainout shelters to a 3-fold difference in irrigation between February and November 2002, as well as to a single large pulse of irrigation water in June 2002. In addition, we documented the effects of the rainout shelters on microclimates under the shelters. Results indicate that relatively more water is available to plants at greater depths on sand-rich soils, whereas on clay-rich soils the greatest water availability is at the surface. Typically, soil moisture under E. lehmanniana was lower than under plots with the native grass Heteropogon contortus, although soil texture and depth modified this pattern. The precipitation shelters had minimal impacts on windspeed, soil temperature, and relative humidity; small differences in microclimatic effects between the soil types were attributed to effects of surrounding vegetation on wind velocity. Differences in soil texture, grass cover and species identity, and amount of irrigation exert interactive controls over soil moisture in this semi-arid environment, but responses are modified by time of year and depth in the soil profile. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Co-occurrence of winter-deciduous and evergreen oaks is common in some Mediterranean-type climate areas. However, whether these species show an overlap in their regeneration niche is still poorly understood. We explored experimentally the changes in survival, growth, biomass partitioning, leaf nitrogen content, and water use efficiency ($\delta$ 13C) in seedlings of a deciduous oak (Quercus cerrioides) and an evergreen oak (Quercus ilex) in response to co-variation in light and water availability. Quercus cerrioides exhibited higher root length, root area, leaf nitrogen content, and less negative $\delta$13C, but lower leafiness than Q. ilex. The interaction between species and light in specific leaf area and root-shoot ratio indicated different mechanisms to overcome water stress in the two oaks, with Q. ilex relying on leaf hardening and Q. cerrioides relying on a high root-shoot ratio. However, the two species showed similar survival and growth in most of the light-water gradient. Ecological inference of these results indicates that seedlings of these species have a similar ability to cope with variations in light and water in spite of their contrasting leaf habit. This similar performance suggests a competition for similar micro-sites during establishment, rather than a partitioning of the regeneration niche.},

abstract = {The distribution of nitrogen between leaves on individual plants of Phaseolus vulgaris and Cucumis sativus which were grown under different irradiances was examined. For Phaseolus, shading treatments were imposed on individual leaflets when they had reached one-third of full expansion. Adjacent leaflets were either grown under the same irradiance or had different irradiances imposed on them. The nitrogen content of leaves depended on their growth irradiance and not on the growth irradiance of adjacent leaflets, with more nitrogen being found in leaves grown under higher irradiance compared to those grown in shade. For Cucumis, the nitrogen contents of the leaves changed following the imposition of shading treatments. The experiment was repeated four times with different nitrate nutrient treatments, twice in combination with a pretreatment growth irradiance of 40% sunlight. The relative changes in leaf nitrogen content for each irradiance treatment were independent of changes to the leaf nitrogen content of the plant and of the growth irradiance prior to the shading treatments. Again, nitrogen contents were highest in leaves grown at high irradiance. Acclimation of individual leaves to their irradiance treatment was seen for both Phaseolus and Cucumis. Growth under shade resulted in lower rates of oxygen evolution per unit of chlorophyll, when measured at high irradiance, and increased partitioning of nitrogen into pigment-protein complexes. These two changes working in opposition to each other meant that for Cucumis, the relationship between photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen content was similar between irradiance treatments. For Phaseolus, the increased partitioning of nitrogen into pigment-protein complexes at low irradiance was not as great as the reduction in photosynthetic rate per unit of chlorophyll, so that the photosynthetic rate per unit leaf nitrogen was less for leaves grown under low irradiance compared to those grown under high irradiance. It is shown that acclimation to lower irradiance can increase the potential daily photosynthesis for a given leaf nitrogen content.},

In this paper, the relative impor- tance of both of these changes in maximizing carbon gain is quantified. Photosynthesis, SLA and nitrogen partitioning within leaves was determined from 10 dicotyledonous C 3 species grown in photon irradiances of 200 and 1000 mmmmmol m-2 s-1 . Photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area measured under the growth irradiance was, on average, three times higher for high-light-grown plants than for those grown under low light, and two times higher when measured near light saturation. However, light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf dry mass was unaltered by growth irradi- ance because low-light plants had double the SLA. Nitro- gen concentrations per unit leaf mass were constant between the two light treatments, but plants grown in low light partitioned a larger fraction of leaf nitrogen into light harvesting. Leaf absorptance was curvilinearly related to chlorophyll content and independent of SLA. Daily photo- synthesis per unit leaf dry mass under low-light conditions was much more responsive to changes in SLA than to nitro- gen partitioning. Under high light, sensitivity to nitrogen partitioning increased, but changes in SLA were still more important.},

abstract = {Multi-model averaging techniques provide opportunities to extract additional information from large ensembles of simulations. In particular, present-day model skill can be used to evaluate their potential performance in future climate simulations. Multi-model averaging methods have been used extensively in climate and hydrological sciences, but they have not been used to constrain projected plant productivity responses to climate change, which is a major uncertainty in Earth system modelling. Here, we use three global observationally orientated estimates of current net primary productivity (NPP) to perform a reliability ensemble averaging (REA) method using 30 global simulations of the 21st century change in NPP based on the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) business as usual emissions scenario. We find that the three REA methods support an increase in global NPP by the end of the 21st century (2095-2099) compared to 2001-2005, which is 2-3% stronger than the ensemble ISIMIP mean value of 24.2Pg C y-1. Using REA also leads to a 45-68% reduction in the global uncertainty of 21st century NPP projection, which strengthens confidence in the resilience of the CO2 fertilization effect to climate change. This reduction in uncertainty is especially clear for boreal ecosystems although it may be an artefact due to the lack of representation of nutrient limitations on NPP in most models. Conversely, the large uncertainty that remains on the sign of the response of NPP in semi-arid regions points to the need for better observations and model development in these regions.},

abstract = {Abstract. Reliable projections of future climate require land–atmosphere carbon (C) fluxes to be represented realistically in Earth System Models. There are several sources of uncertainty in how carbon is parameterized in these models. First, while interactions between the C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles have been implemented in some models, these lead to diverse changes in land–atmosphere fluxes. Second, while the parameterization of soil organic matter decomposition is similar between models, formulations of the control of the soil physical state on microbial activity vary widely. We address these sources uncertainty by implementing three soil moisture (SMRF) and three soil temperature (STRF) respiration functions in an Earth System Model that can be run with three degrees of biogeochemical nutrient limitation (C-only, C and N, and C and N and P). All 27 possible combinations of a SMRF with a STRF and a biogeochemical mode are equilibrated before transient historical (1850–2005) simulations are performed. As expected, implementing N and P limitation reduces the land carbon sink, transforming some regions from net sinks to net sources over the historical period (1850–2005). Differences in the soil C balance implied by the various SMRFs and STRFs also change the sign of some regional sinks. Further, although the absolute uncertainty in global carbon uptake is reduced, the uncertainty due to the SMRFs and STRFs grows relative to the inter-annual variability in net uptake when N and P limitations are added. We also demonstrate that the equilibrated soil C also depend on the shape of the SMRF and STRF. Equilibration using different STRFs and SMRFs and nutrient limitation generates a six-fold range of global soil C that largely mirrors the range in available (17) CMIP5 models. Simulating the historical change in soil carbon therefore critically depends on the choice of STRF, SMRF and nutrient limitation, as it controls the equilibrated state to which transient conditions are applied. This direct effect of the representation of microbial decomposition in Earth System Models adds to recent concerns on the adequacy of these simple representations of very complex soil carbon processes.},

abstract = {Aims: This review was developed to introduce the essential components and variants of structural equation modeling (SEM), synthesize the common issues in SEM applications, and share our views on SEM's future in ecological research. Methods: We searched the Web of Science on SEM applications in ecological studies from 1999 through 2016 and summarized the potential of SEMs, with a special focus on unexplored uses in ecology. We also analyzed and discussed the common issues with SEM applications in previous publications and presented our view for its future applications. Results: We searched and found 146 relevant publications on SEM applications in ecological studies. We found that five SEM variants had not commenly been applied in ecology, including the latent growth curve model, Bayesian SEM, partial least square SEM, hierarchical SEM, and variable/model selection. We identified ten common issues in SEM applications including strength of causal assumption, specification of feedback loops, selection of models and variables, identification of models, methods of estimation, explanation of latent variables, selection of fit indices, report of results, estimation of sample size, and the fit of model. Conclusions: In previous ecological studies, measurements of latent variables, explanations of model parameters, and reports of key statistics were commonly overlooked, while several advanced uses of SEM had been ignored overall. With the increasing availability of data, the use of SEM holds immense potential for ecologists in the future.},

abstract = {Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes, or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation, and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable barriers to making practical use of this technique have been discussed.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that individuals from invasive populations of many different plant species grow larger than individuals from native populations and that this difference has a genetic basis. This increased vigor in invasive populations is thought to be due to life history tradeoffs, in which selection favors the loss of costly defense traits, thereby freeing resources that can be devoted to increased growth or fecundity. Despite the theoretical importance of such allocation shifts for invasions, there have been no efforts to understand apparent evolutionary shifts in defense-growth allocation mechanistically. Reallocation of nitrogen (N) to photosynthesis is likely to play a crucial role in any growth increase; however, no study has been conducted to explore potential evolutionary changes in N allocation of introduced plants. Here, we show that introduced Ageratina adenophora, a noxious invasive plant throughout the subtropics, appears to have evolved increased N allocation to photosynthesis (growth) and reduced allocation to cell walls, resulting in poorer structural defenses. Our results provide a potential mechanism behind the commonly observed and genetically based increase in plant growth and vigor when they are introduced to new ranges. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Leaf traits are frequently measured in ecology to provide a ‘common currency' for predicting how anthropogenic pressures impact ecosystem function. Here, we test whether leaf traits consistently respond to experimental treatments across 27 glob- ally distributed grassland sites across 4 continents. We find that specific leaf area (leaf area per unit mass)—a commonly measured morphological trait inferring shifts between plant growth strategies—did not respond to up to four years of soil nutri- ent additions. Leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations increased in response to the addition of each respec- tive soil nutrient. We found few significant changes in leaf traits when vertebrate herbivores were excluded in the short-term. SLA, and leaf nitrogen and potassium concentrations were positively correlated with species turnover, suggesting interspecific trait variation was a significant predictor of these traits, but not of leaf phosphorus concentration. Climatic conditions and pretreatment soil nutrient levels also accounted for significant amounts of variation in the leaf traits measured. Overall, we find that leaf morphological traits, such as specific leaf area, are not appropriate indicators of plant response to anthropogenic perturbations in grasslands.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) generally limits plant growth and controls biosphere responses to climate change. We introduce a new mathematical model of plant N acquisition, called Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN), based on active and passive soil N uptake, leaf N retranslocation, and biological N fixation. This model is unified under the theoretical framework of carbon (C) cost economics, or resource optimization. FUN specifies C allocated to N acquisition as well as remaining C for growth, or N-limitation to growth. We test the model with data from a wide range of sites (observed versus predicted N uptake r2 is 0.89, and RMSE is 0.003 kg N m−2{\textperiodcentered}yr−1). Four model tests are performed: (1) fixers versus nonfixers under primary succession; (2) response to N fertilization; (3) response to CO2 fertilization; and (4) changes in vegetation C from potential soil N trajectories for five DGVMs (HYLAND, LPJ, ORCHIDEE, SDGVM, and TRIFFID) under four IPCC scenarios. Nonfixers surpass the productivity of fixers after ∼150–180 years in this scenario. FUN replicates the N uptake response in the experimental N fertilization from a modeled N fertilization. However, FUN cannot replicate the N uptake response in the experimental CO2 fertilization from a modeled CO2 fertilization; nonetheless, the correct response is obtained when differences in root biomass are included. Finally, N-limitation decreases biomass by 50 Pg C on average globally for the DGVMs. We propose this model as being suitable for inclusion in the new generation of Earth system models that aim to describe the global N cycle.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two dominant nutrients regulating the productivity of most terrestrial ecosystems. The growing imbalance of anthropogenic N and P inputs into the future is estimated to exacerbate P limitation on land and limit the land carbon (C) sink, so that we hypothesized that P limitation will increasingly reduce C sequestered per unit N deposited into the future. Using a global land surface model (CABLE), we simulated the effects of increased N deposition with and without P limitation on land C uptake and the fate of deposited N on land from 1901 to 2100. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that N deposition continued to induce land C sequestration into the future, contributing to 15% of future C sequestration as opposed to 6% over the historical period. P limitation reduced the future land C uptake per unit N deposited only moderately at the global scale but P limitation increasingly caused N deposition to have net negative effects on the land C balance in the temperate zone. P limitation further increased the fraction of deposited N that is lost via leaching to aquatic ecosystems, globally from 38.5% over the historical period to 53% into the future, and up to 75% in tropical ecosystems. Our results suggest continued N demand for plant productivity but also indicate growing adverse N deposition effects in the future biosphere, not fully accounted for in global models, emphasizing the urgent need to elaborate on model representations of N and P dynamics.},

abstract = {The chapter discusses the manner in which microbial life in soil has been studied intensively and how a multitude of parameters are available for its characterization. The organic and especially the microbiological properties of soil are often extremely heterogeneous in the field. Samples should be transferred to the laboratory as soon as possible after sampling to avoid dramatic changes in microbial populations and activities. For studying the transport of chemicals in soil, estimation of microbial biomass or enzyme activity and the soil needs to be sterilized, and microbial activities need to be inhibited. All (bio) chemical transformations in soil are influenced by the proton activity in the soil solution, which is usually given as the pH value. In structured soils, microorganisms are usually situated at the surface of or inside the single aggregates which form the bulk soil. Organic carbon is essential to microorganisms not only as a nutrient source, but also as a physical soil conditioner that influences soil aggregation and water characteristics. Lignin is considered to be one of the major precursors of aromatic carbon in humic compounds. Soil scientists have used physical separation techniques to study humification processes and an organic fraction with varying percentages between 5% and 95% of the total for each. The colorimetric analysis of soil extracts reflects the total (detectable) quantity of extracted phosphorus (P), irrespective of the individual chemical structure of P compounds. Bulk density is the dry weight per unit volume of soil; it is useful for converting a weight-based result to a volume-based number.},

abstract = {In the context of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, most climate simulations use prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and therefore do not interactively include the effect of carbon cycle feedbacks. However, the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario has additionally been run by earth system models with prescribed CO2 emissions. This paper analyzes the climate projections of 11 earth system models (ESMs) that performed both emission-driven and concentration-driven RCP8.5 simulations.When forced by RCP8.5 CO2 emissions, models simulate a large spread in atmospheric CO2; the simulated 2100 concentrations range between 795 and 1145 ppm. Seven out of the 11 ESMs simulate a larger CO2 (on average by 44 ppm, 985 ± 97ppm by 2100) and hence higher radiative forcing (by 0.25Wm-2) when driven by CO2 emissions than for the concentration-driven scenarios (941 ppm). However, most of these models already overestimate the present-day CO2, with the present-day biases reasonably well correlated with future atmospheric concentrations' departure from the prescribed concentration. The uncertainty in CO2 projections is mainly attributable to uncertainties in the response of the land carbon cycle. As a result of simulated higher CO2 concentrations than in the concentration-driven simulations, temperature projections are generally higher when ESMs are driven with CO2 emissions. Global surface temperature change by 2100 (relative to present day) increased by 3.9° ± 0.9°C for the emission-driven simulations compared to 3.7° ± 0.7°C in the concentration-driven simulations. Although the lower ends are comparable in both sets of simulations, the highest climate projections are significantly warmer in the emission-driven simulations because of stronger carbon cycle feedbacks. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

A variety of data sets are used to construct global N budgets for 1860 and the early 1990s and to make projections for the global N budget in 2050. Regional N budgets for Asia, North America, and other major regions for the early 1990s, as well as the marine N budget, are presented to highlight the dominant fluxes of nitrogen in each region. Important findings are that human activities increasingly dominate the N budget at the global and at most regional scales, the terrestrial and open ocean N budgets are essentially disconnected, and the fixed forms of N are accumulating in most environmental reservoirs. The largest uncertainties in our understanding of the N budget at most scales are the rates of natural biological nitrogen fixation, the amount of Nr storage in most environmental reservoirs, and the production rates of N2 by denitrification. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Altered environmental conditions may change populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and thereby affect mycorrhizal functioning. We investigated whether 8 yr of free-air CO2 enrichment has selected fungi that differently influence the nutrition and growth of host plants. In a controlled pot experiment, two sets of seven randomly picked single spore isolates, originating from field plots of elevated (60 Pa) or ambient CO2 partial pressure (pCO2), were inoculated on nodulated Trifolium repens (white clover) plants. Fungal isolates belonged to the Glomus claroideum or Glomus intraradices species complex, and host plants were clonal micropropagates derived from nine genets. Total nitrogen (N) concentration was increased in leaves of plants inoculated with fungal isolates from elevated-pCO2 plots. These isolates took up nearly twice as much N from the soil as isolates from ambient-pCO2 plots and showed much greater stimulation of biological N2 fixation. The morpho-species identity of isolates had a more pronounced effect on N2 fixation and on root length colonized than isolate identity. We conclude that rising atmospheric pCO2 may select for fungal strains that will help their host plants to meet increased N demands.},

At both sites where mortality was monitored, many emerging seedlings were killed in early spring by tortricid caterpillars, especially Clepsis melaleucana. Leaves of older seedlings were damaged by various caterpillars, Typhlocyba leafhoppers, Cristulariella depraedans leaf spot disease, and others.

The respiration rates of all parts of the plants were closely related to ambient temperature. On a unit dry-weight basis leaves respire faster than stalks at the same temperature. However, as the stalks grow and their dry weight increases with age and greatly exceeds that of the leaves the greatest loss of carbohydrate by respiration occurs from the stalks. The percentage loss of gross photosynthate due to respiration has been estimated for different stages of growth. The loss depends on the age of the plant and the relative proportions of leaf and stalk. It can range from some 20 per cent in actively growing young plants to at least 50 per cent in 18-month-old plants of an irrigated crop in Natal.},

abstract = {Abstract. Terrestrial carbon (C) cycle models applied for climate projections simulate a strong increase in net primary productivity (NPP) due to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century. These models usually neglect the limited availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), nutrients that commonly limit plant growth and soil carbon turnover. To investigate how the projected C sequestration is altered when stoichiometric constraints on C cycling are considered, we incorporated a P cycle into the land surface model JSBACH, which already includes representations of coupled C and N cycles. The model reveals a distinct geographic pattern of P and N limitation. Under the SRES A1B scenario, the accumulated land C uptake between 1860 and 2100 is 13% (particularly at high latitudes) and 16% (particularly at low latitudes) lower in simulations with N and P cycling, respectively, than in simulations without nutrient cycles. The combined effect of both nutrients reduces land C uptake by 25% compared to simulations without N or P cycling. However, the quantification of P limitation remains challenging as the poorly constrained processes of soil P sorption and biochemical mineralization strongly influence the strength of P limitation. After 2100, increased temperatures (+5 K) and high CO2 (700 ppm) concentrations cause a shift from N to P limitation at high latitudes, while nutrient limitation in the tropics declines. The increase in P limitation at high-latitudes is induced by a strong increase in NPP and the low P sorption capacity of soils, while a decline in tropical NPP due to high autotrophic respiration rates alleviates N and P limitation. These findings indicate that global land C uptake in the 21st century is likely overestimated in models that neglect P and N limitation. In the long-term, insufficient P availability might become an important constraint on C cycling at high latitudes. Accordingly, we argue that the P cycle must be included in global models used for C cycle projections.},

abstract = {Increases in terrestrial water-use efficiency (WUE) have been reported in many studies, pointing to potential changes in physiological forcing of global carbon and hydrological cycles. However, gains in WUE are of uncertain magnitude over longer (i.e. >10 years) periods of time largely owing to difficulties in accounting for structural and physiological acclimation. 13 C signatures (i.e. $\delta$13 C) of plant organic matter have long been used to estimate WUE at temporal scales ranging from days to centuries. Mesophyll conductance is a key uncertainty in estimated WUE owing to its influ- ence on diffusion of CO2 to sites of carboxylation. Here we apply new knowledge of mesophyll conductance to 464 $\delta$13 C chronologies in tree-rings of 143 species span- ning global biomes. Adjusted for mesophyll conductance, gains in WUE during the 20th century (0.15 ppm year−1) were considerably smaller than those estimated from conventional modelling (0.26 ppm year−1). Across the globe, mean sensitivity of WUE to atmospheric CO2 was 0.15 ppm ppm−1. Ratios of internal-to-atmospheric CO2 (on a mole fraction basis; ci /ca ) in leaves were mostly constant over time but differed among biomes and plant taxa—highlighting the significance of both plant structure and phys- iology. Together with synchronized responses in stomatal and mesophyll conduct- ance, our results suggest that ratios of chloroplastic-to-atmospheric CO2 (cc /ca ) are constrained over time. We conclude that forest WUE may have not increased as much as previously suggested and that projections of future climate forcing via CO2 fertili- zation may need to be adjusted accordingly.},

abstract = {Ten soils, with the same type of clay and under the same management but having different clay contents, were amended with 14C-labelled glucose and incubated for 90 days to determine the influence of texture on the turnover of C through the microbial biomass. After 90 days, there was little difference among the soils in residual 14C. However, rates of CO2 evolution and mineralization indicated that during the first day of incubation, the rate of decomposition of substrate C was greater in soils with more clay. From 1 to 5 days the turnover of C through the biomass was relatively slower in these soils. Total biomass C (labelled + unlabelled C) contents reached maximal amounts after 1.25 days and were maintained at higher quantities in soils with greater amounts of clay until the end of the incubation. Biomass 14C was maintained at higher amounts in soils with more clay but only until 45 days. The proportion of C derived from the labelled glucose and incorporated in the biomass ranged from 59 to 73% after 1.25 days and from 16 to 20% after 90 days. The unlabelled biomass was significantly correlated with the amount of clay at all sampling dates and appeared to be qualitatively different than the labelled biomass in the heavy tcxturcd soils. After 1.25 days of incubation, the non-living 14C accounted for 12 to 23% of added to glucose 14C; after 90 days it ranged from 11 to 20%. The ratio of living to non-living 14C was consistently higher in soils with more clay. This was attributed to adsorption of non-living C by clay and to product utilization by a secondary population. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The vegetation component in climate models has advanced since the late 1960s from a uniform prescription of surface parameters to plant functional types (PFTs). PFTs are used in global land-surface models to provide parameter values for every model grid cell. With a simple photosynthesis model we derive parameters for all site years within the Fluxnet eddy covariance data set. We compare the model parameters within and between PFTs and statistically group the sites. Fluxnet data is used to validate the photosynthesis model parameter variation within a PFT classification. Our major result is that model parameters appear more variable than assumed in PFTs. Simulated fluxes are of higher quality when model parameters of individual sites or site years are used. A simplification with less variation in model parameters results in poorer simulations. This indicates that a PFT classification introduces uncertainty in the variation of the photosynthesis and transpiration fluxes. Statistically derived groups of sites with comparable model parameters do not share common vegetation types or climates. A simple PFT classification does not reflect the real photosynthesis and transpiration variation. Although site year parameters give the best predictions, the parameters are generally too specific to be used in a global study. The site year parameters can be further used to explore the possibilities of alternative classification schemes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recent decades have been characterized by increasing temperatures worldwide, resulting in an exponential climb in vapor pressure deficit (VPD). VPD has been identified as an increasingly important driver of plant functioning in terrestrial biomes and has been established as a major contributor in recent drought-induced plant mortality independent of other drivers associated with climate change. Despite this, few studies have isolated the physiological response of plant functioning to high VPD, thus limiting our understanding and ability to predict future impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. An abundance of evidence suggests that stomatal conductance declines under high VPD and transpiration increases in most species up until a given VPD threshold, leading to a cascade of subsequent impacts including reduced photosynthesis and growth, and higher risks of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Incorporation of photosynthetic and hydraulic traits in ‘next-generation' land-surface models has the greatest potential for improved prediction of VPD responses at the plant- and global-scale, and will yield more mechanistic simulations of plant responses to a changing climate. By providing a fully integrated framework and evaluation of the impacts of high VPD on plant function, improvements in forecasting and long-term projections of climate impacts can be made.},

@article{Guerrieri2011,
abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effects of long-term repeated aerial nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) misting over tree canopies of a Sitka spruce plantation in Scotland. We combined $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O in tree rings to evaluate the changes in CO2 assimilation (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) and to assess their contribution to variations in the intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi, i.e., the A/gs ratio). Measurements of $\delta$15N enabled shifts in the ecosystem N cycling following misting to be assessed. We found that: (i) N applications, with or without S, increased the ratio between A and gs in favour of A, thus supporting a fertilizer effect of added N. (ii) After the treatments ceased, the trees quickly adjusted to the reductions of N deposition, but not to the reduction in S deposition, which had a negative effect on WUEi by reducing A. This indicates that the beneficial role of N deposition may be negated in forests that previously received a high load of acid rain. (iii) $\delta$15N in tree rings reflected the N dynamics caused by canopy retention, with the fingerprint also present in the litter, after the experiment stopped. (iv) Both our results (obtained using canopy applications) and a collection of published data (obtained using soil applications) showed that generally WUEi increased in response to an increase of N applications, with the magnitude of the changes related to soil conditions and the availability of other nutrients. The shifts observed in $\delta$15N in tree rings also suggest that both the quantity of the applied N and its quality, mediated by processes occurring during canopy N retention, are important determinants of the interactions between N and C cycles. Stable isotopes are useful probes to understand these processes and to put the results of short-term experiments into context. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Gutschick1981,
abstract = {Eleven features of nitrogen metabolism in the plant and in the ecosystem are delineated, each appearing to have negative survival value, especially negative effects on yield. These include apparent failures in controls over N2 fixation and over nitrate uptake; preventable energy losses in soil microbial metabolism and in root reduction in nitrate; preventable mass losses of nitrogen via denitrification and ammonia volatilization, and insufficient partitioning of photosynthetic energy to support N2 fixation in N-limited ecosystems. A quantitative examination of the energetics of metabolizing N2, NH3, and NO3 - reveals behind often high costs some energy inefficiencies required for sufficiently fast kinetics and some compromises with other metabolisms. Cost: benefit ratios can be defined for assimilation of the three forms of N, and each ratio may vary significantly according to other physiological demands, such as pH control at the rhizosphere or stomatal closure for efficient use of water. For the individual plant, I then proposed a number of metabolic principles based on the energetics inside the plant, suitably constrained, and also compromised with the metabolic strategy of soil bacteria. These principles rank-order the preferences for N sources. They also outline complementary roles for normal fast or feedback controls based on immediate environmental variations, integrative controls over relative growth rates of tissues, and nonnutritional controls that schedule maturation. The overall view is that plants in their N-nutrition follow a set of quantifiable strategies, or simple patterns in metabolic adaptations to varied conditions. The goal is to maximize yield over a range of conditions, but at times to sacrifice yield potential for clear requirements such as early competitiveness in canopy expansion. The strategies are heavily conditioned by energetics. Indeed, many are principally patterns of optimally allocating photosynthetic (energy) resources between alternatives such as N2 versus NO3 - assimilation. I note that agricultural breeding to alter adaptation ranges and to increase yield readily incurs conflicts of desired traits, such as that between ability to use high levels of fertilizer N and ability to mature. I propose that conflicts are easier to foresee between strategies (controlled blocks of biochemical activities, in genetically fixed patterns) than between individual biochemical activities. A second general use of the strategic view may be simpler prediction of overall plant responses to environmental changes (in atmospheric CO2 levels, soil aeration and acidity, etc.). When one considers competitive uptake of nitrogen by all the plants in an ecosystem, additional plant responses are seen as necessary. Also, a few inherent instabilities of strategies are seen in N2 fixation and in denitrification.},

abstract = {Summary: Leaf-level determinants of species environmental stress tolerance are still poorly understood. Here, we explored dependencies of species shade (Tshade) and drought (Tdrought) tolerance scores on key leaf structural and functional traits in 339 Northern Hemisphere temperate woody species. • In general, Tshade was positively associated with leaf life-span (LL), and negatively with leaf dry mass (M A), nitrogen content (NA), and photosynthetic capacity (AA) per area, while opposite relationships were observed with drought tolerance. Different trait combinations responsible for T shade and Tdrought were observed among the key plant functional types: deciduous and evergreen broadleaves and evergreen conifers. • According to principal component analysis, resource-conserving species with low N content and photosynthetic capacity, and high LL and MA, had higher Tdrought, consistent with the general stress tolerance strategy, whereas variation in Tshade did not concur with the postulated stress tolerance strategy. • As drought and shade often interact in natural communities, reverse effects of foliar traits on these key environmental stress tolerances demonstrate that species niche differentiation is inherently constrained in temperate woody species. Different combinations of traits among key plant functional types further explain the contrasting bivariate correlations often observed in studies seeking functional explanation of variation in species environmental tolerances. {\textcopyright} 2009 New Phytologist.},

To determine how much of this decline was associated with allocating a greater proportion of leaf nitrogen into cell wall material, we compared two groups of plants. The first group consisted of two species from each of eight genera, all of which were perennial evergreens growing in the Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG). The second group consisted of seven Eucalyptus species growing in a greenhouse. The percentage of leaf biomass in cell walls was independent of variation in LMA within any genus, but varied from 25 to 65% between genera. The nitrogen concentration of cell wall material was 0.4 times leaf nitrogen concentration for all species apart from Eucalyptus, which was 0.6 times leaf nitrogen concentration. Between 10 and 30% of leaf nitrogen was recovered in the cell wall fraction, but this was independent of LMA. No trade-off was observed between nitrogen associated with cell walls and the nitrogen allocated to ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Variation in photosynthetic rate per unit nitrogen could not be explained by variation in cell wall nitrogen. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},

abstract = {Global vegetation and land-surface models embody interdisciplinary scientific understanding of the behaviour of plants and ecosystems, and are indispensable to project the impacts of environmental change on vegetation and the interactions between vegetation and climate. However, systematic errors and persistently large differences among carbon and water cycle projections by different models highlight the limitations of current process formulations. In this review, focusing on core plant functions in the terrestrial carbon and water cycles, we show how unifying hypotheses derived from eco-evolutionary optimality (EEO) principles can provide novel, parameter-sparse representations of plant and vegetation processes. We present case studies that demonstrate how EEO generates parsimonious representations of core, leaf-level processes that are individually testable and supported by evidence. EEO approaches to photosynthesis and primary production, dark respiration and stomatal behaviour are ripe for implementation in global models. EEO approaches to other important traits, including the leaf economics spectrum and applications of EEO at the community level are active research areas. Independently tested modules emerging from EEO studies could profitably be integrated into modelling frameworks that account for the multiple time scales on which plants and plant communities adjust to environmental change.},

@article{Heskel2016,
abstract = {Plant respiration constitutes a massive carbon flux to the atmosphere, and a major control on the evolution of the global carbon cycle. It therefore has the potential to modulate levels of climate change due to the human burning of fossil fuels. Neither current physiological nor terrestrial biosphere models adequately describe its short-term temperature response, and even minor differences in the shape of the response curve can significantly impact estimates of ecosystem carbon release and/or storage. Given this, it is critical to establish whether there are predictable patterns in the shape of the respiration–temperature response curve, and thus in the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of respiration across the globe. Analyzing measurements in a comprehensive database for 231 species spanning 7 biomes, we demonstrate that temperature-dependent increases in leaf respiration do not follow a commonly used exponential function. Instead, we find a decelerating function as leaves warm, reflecting a declining sensitivity to higher temperatures that is remarkably uniform across all biomes and plant functional types. Such convergence in the temperature sensitivity of leaf respiration suggests that there are universally applicable controls on the temperature response of plant energy metabolism, such that a single new function can predict the temperature dependence of leaf respiration for global vegetation. This simple function enables straightforward description of plant respiration in the land-surface components of coupled earth system models. Our cross-biome analyses shows significant implications for such fluxes in cold climates, generally projecting lower values compared with previous estimates.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are essential nutrients for photosynthetic carbon assimilation and most frequently limit primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Efficient use of those nutrients is important for plants growing in nutrient-poor environments. We investigated the pattern of photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency (PPUE) in comparison with photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) along gradients of P and N availability across biomes with 340 tree and shrub species. We used both total soil N and P concentration and foliar N/P ratios for indicating nutrient-availability gradients. Photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency increased with greater leaf mass per area (LMA) toward decreasing P availability. By contrast, PNUE decreased with greater LMA towards decreasing N and P availability. The increase in PPUE with decreasing P availability was caused by the net effects of a relatively greater reduction in foliar P concentration and a relatively constant photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate. The decrease in PNUE with decreasing N availability was caused by the effects of a reduction in photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate with greater LMA. Synthesis. Our results suggest that higher PPUE may be an effective leaf-level adaptation to P-poor soils, especially in tropical tree species. Future research should focus on the difference between PPUE and PNUE in relation to leaf economics, physiology and strategy. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic capacity is known to vary considerably among species. Its physiological cause and ecological significance have been one of the most fundamental questions in plant ecophysiology. We studied the contents of Rubisco (a key enzyme of photosynthesis) and cell walls in leaves of 26 species with a large variation in photosynthetic rates. We focused on photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE, photosynthetic rate per nitrogen), which can be expressed as the product of Rubisco-use efficiency (RBUE, photosynthetic rate per Rubisco) and Rubisco nitrogen fraction (RNF, Rubisco nitrogen per total leaf nitrogen). RBUE accounted for 70% of the interspecific variation in PNUE. The variation in RBUE was ascribed partly to stomatal conductance, and other factors such as mesophyll conductance and Rubisco kinetics might also be involved. RNF was also significantly related to PNUE but the correlation was relatively weak. Cell wall nitrogen fraction (WNF, cell wall nitrogen per total leaf nitrogen) increased with increasing leaf mass per area, but there was no correlation between RNF and WNF. These results suggest that nitrogen allocation to cell walls does not explain the variation in PNUE. The difference in PNUE was not caused by a sole factor that was markedly different among species but by several factors each of which was slightly disadvantageous in low PNUE species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) limitation of aboveground plant production is usually assumed to occur in tropical regions but rarely elsewhere. Here we report that such P limitation is more widespread and much stronger than previously estimated. In our global meta-analysis, almost half (46.2%) of 652 P-addition field experiments reveal a significant P limitation on aboveground plant production. Globally, P additions increase aboveground plant production by 34.9% in natural terrestrial ecosystems, which is 7.0–15.9% higher than previously suggested. In croplands, by contrast, P additions increase aboveground plant production by only 13.9%, probably because of historical fertilizations. The magnitude of P limitation also differs among climate zones and regions, and is driven by climate, ecosystem properties, and fertilization regimes. In addition to confirming that P limitation is widespread in tropical regions, our study demonstrates that P limitation often occurs in other regions. This suggests that previous studies have underestimated the importance of altered P supply on aboveground plant production in natural terrestrial ecosystems.},

We hypothesized that variation in lb should be related to species' positions along a trade-off between relative growth rate (RGR) and photosynthetic water-use efficiency (WUE) because lb is a species-specific function of growing-season precipitation. We found that demographically variable species have greater RGR and greater leaf carbon isotope discrimination (A, a proxy inversely related to WUE). We examined leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic characteristics and found that, in this system, variation in A is a function of photosynthetic demand rather than stomatal regulation of water loss. The physiological characteristics that result in low A in some species may confer greater photosynthetic performance during the reliably moist but low temperature periods that immediately follow winter rainfall in the Sonoran Desert or alternatively during cool periods of the day or early growing season. Conversely, while species with high A and high RGR exhibit low leaf N, they have high biomass allocation to canopy leaf area display. Such trait associations may allow for greater performance during the infrequent conditions where high soil moisture persists into warmer conditions, resulting in high demographic variance. Alternatively, high variance could arise from specialization to warm periods of the day or season. Population dynamic buffering via stress tolerance (low RGR and A) correlates negatively with buffering via seed banks, as predicted by bet-hedging theory. By merging analyses of population dynamics with functional trait relationships, we develop a deeper understanding of the physiological, ecological, and evolutionary mechanisms involved in population and community dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The understory shrub Lindera benzoin L. experiences lower rates of herbivory in sun environments than in shade environments. The production of secondary metabolites (e.g., phenolic compounds with known plant defense properties) is one likely contributor to these observed differences in herbivory. This work determined the total phenolic content as well as the concentrations of several individual phenolic acids in L. benzoin leaves found in sun and shade habitats. Total phenolic concentrations were determined to be higher in leaves from sun plants than in those from shade plants (47.5 ± 2.4 vs. 28.6 ± 1.3 gallic acid equivalents, respectively). High-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection was used to separate and quantify several individual phenolic acids, and specific compounds were identified based on their retention times and ultraviolet spectra. The concentrations of vanillic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids were shown to be statistically higher in leaves from sun plants than in those from shade plants (P < 0.05), whereas 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and caffeic acid were not significantly different in L. benzoin leaves from sun versus shade habitats.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential macro-nutrient required for plant metabolism and growth. Low P availability could potentially limit plant responses to elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2), but consensus has yet to be reached on the extent of this limitation. Here, based on data from experiments that manipulated both CO2 and P for young individuals of woody and non-woody species, we present a meta-analysis of P limitation impacts on plant growth, physiological, and morphological response to eCO2. We show that low P availability attenuated plant photosynthetic response to eCO2 by approximately one-quarter, leading to a reduced, but still positive photosynthetic response to eCO2 compared to those under high P availability. Furthermore, low P limited plant aboveground, belowground, and total biomass responses to eCO2, by 14.7%, 14.3%, and 12.4%, respectively, equivalent to an approximate halving of the eCO2 responses observed under high P availability. In comparison, low P availability did not significantly alter the eCO2-induced changes in plant tissue nutrient concentration, suggesting tissue nutrient flexibility is an important mechanism allowing biomass response to eCO2 under low P availability. Low P significantly reduced the eCO2-induced increase in leaf area by 14.3%, mirroring the aboveground biomass response, but low P did not affect the eCO2-induced increase in root length. Woody plants exhibited stronger attenuation effect of low P on aboveground biomass response to eCO2 than non-woody plants, while plants with different mycorrhizal associations showed similar responses to low P and eCO2 interaction. This meta-analysis highlights crucial data gaps in capturing plant responses to eCO2 and low P availability. Field-based experiments with longer-term exposure of both CO2 and P manipulations are critically needed to provide ecosystem-scale understanding. Taken together, our results provide a quantitative baseline to constrain model-based hypotheses of plant responses to eCO2 under P limitation, thereby improving projections of future global change impacts.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) availability is increasing dramatically in many ecosystems, but the influence of elevated N on the functioning of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in natural ecosystems is not well understood. We measured AM fungal community structure and mycorrhizal function simultaneously across an experimental N addition gradient in an alpine meadow that is limited by N but not by phosphorus (P). AM fungal communities at both whole-plant-community (mixed roots) and single-plant-species (Elymus nutans roots) scales were described using pyro-sequencing, and the mycorrhizal functioning was quantified using a mycorrhizal-suppression treatment in the field (whole-plant-community scale) and a glasshouse inoculation experiment (single-plant-species scale). Nitrogen enrichment progressively reduced AM fungal abundance, changed AM fungal community composition, and shifted mycorrhizal functioning towards parasitism at both whole-plant-community and E. nutans scales. N-induced shifts in AM fungal community composition were tightly linked to soil N availability and/or plant species richness, whereas the shifts in mycorrhizal function were associated with the communities of specific AM fungal lineages. The observed changes in both AM fungal community structure and functioning across an N enrichment gradient highlight that N enrichment of ecosystems that are not P-limited can induce parasitic mycorrhizal functioning and influence plant community structure and ecosystem sustainability.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits can predict community assembly and ecosystem functioning and are thus widely used in global models of vegetation dynamics and land–climate feedbacks. Still, we lack a global understanding of how land and climate affect plant traits. A previous global analysis of six traits observed two main axes of variation: (1) size variation at the organ and plant level and (2) leaf economics balancing leaf persistence against plant growth potential. The orthogonality of these two axes suggests they are differently influenced by environmental drivers. We find that these axes persist in a global dataset of 17 traits across more than 20,000 species. We find a dominant joint effect of climate and soil on trait variation. Additional independent climate effects are also observed across most traits, whereas independent soil effects are almost exclusively observed for economics traits. Variation in size traits correlates well with a latitudinal gradient related to water or energy limitation. In contrast, variation in economics traits is better explained by interactions of climate with soil fertility. These findings have the potential to improve our understanding of biodiversity patterns and our predictions of climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycles.},

The objective of this study was to develop a reliable method for simultaneous analyses of soil Al, NH4-N and NO3-N using a Flow Injection Autoanalyzer. Thirty-five soil samples from different locations with wide ranges of extractable Al, NH4-N and NO3-N were selected for this study. Aluminum, NH4-N and NO3-N were extracted by both 1 M and 2 M potassium chloride (KCl), and quantified using a LACHAT Flow Injection Autoanalyzer simultaneously and separately. One molar KCl was found to be a suitable extractant for all three compounds when compared to 2 M KCl. The 1 M KCl extract proposed could aid in decreasing the costs associated with simultaneous NH4-N, NO3-N, and Al analyses. Results of those three compounds analyzed simultaneously were not statistically different from those analyzed separately in 1 M KCl solution. This new procedure of simultaneous determination of NH4-N, NO3-N, and Al increases efficiency and reduces cost for soil test laboratories and laboratory users.},

abstract = {Rhizobial and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses each may consume 4–16% of recently photosyn- thetically-fixed carbon to maintain their growth, activity and reserves. Rhizobia and AM fungi improve plant photosynthesis through N and P acquisition, but increased nutrient uptake by these symbionts does not fully explain observed increases in the rate of photosynthesis of symbiotic plants. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that carbon sink strength of rhizobial and AM symbioses stimulates the rates of photosynthesis. Nutrient-independent effects of rhizobial and AM symbioses result in direct compen- sation of C costs at the source. We calculated the response ratios of photosynthesis and nutrient mass fraction in the leaves of legumes inoculated with rhizobial and/or AM fungi relative to non-inoculated plants in a number of published studies. On average, photosynthetic rates were significantly increased by 28 and 14% due to rhizobial and AM symbioses, respectively, and 51% due to dual symbiosis. The leaf P mass fraction was increased significantly by 13% due to rhizobial symbioses. Although the increases were not significant, AM symbioses increased leaf P mass fraction by 6% and dual symbioses by 41%. The leaf N mass fraction was not significantly affected by any of the rhizobial, AM and dual symbioses. The rate of photosynthesis increased substantially more than the C costs of the rhizobial and AM symbioses. The inoculation of legumes with rhizobia and/or AM fungi, which resulted in sink stimulation of photo- synthesis, improved the photosynthetic nutrient use efficiency and the proportion of seed yield in relation to the total plant biomass (harvest index). Sink stimulation represent an adaptation mechanism that allows legumes to take advantage of nutrient supply from their microsymbionts without compromising the total amount of photosynthates available for plant growth.},

abstract = {Plant traits—the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants—determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form'. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic capacity and its relationship to leaf nitrogen content are two of the most sensitive parameters of terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) whose representation in global-scale simulations has been severely hampered by a lack of systematic analyses using a sufficiently broad database. Here, we use data of qualitative traits, climate and soil to subdivide the terrestrial vegetation into functional types (PFT), and then assimilate observations of carboxylation capacity, Vmax (723 data points), and maximum photosynthesis rates, Amax (776 data points), into the C3 photosynthesis model proposed by Farquhar et al. to constrain the relationship of Vmax25 (Vmax normalised to 25°C) to leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area for each PFT. In a second step, the resulting functions are used to predict Vmax25 per PFT from easily measurable values of leaf nitrogen content in natural vegetation (1966 data points). Mean values of Vmax25 thus obtained are implemented into a TBM (BETHY within the coupled climate-vegetation model ECHAM5/JSBACH) and modelled gross primary production (GPP) is compared with independent observations on stand scale. Apart from providing parameter ranges per PFT constrained from much more comprehensive data, the results of this analysis enable several major improvements on previous parameterisations. (1) The range of mean Vmax25 between PFTs is dominated by differences of photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, defined as Vmax25 divided by leaf nitrogen content), while within each PFT, the scatter of Vmax25 values is dominated by the high variability of leaf nitrogen content. (2) We find a systematic depression of NUE on certain tropical soils that are known to be deficient in phosphorous. (3) Vmax25 of tropical trees derived by this study is substantially lower than earlier estimates currently used in TBMs, with an obvious effect on modelled GPP and surface temperature. (4) The root-mean-squared difference between modelled and observed GPP is substantially reduced. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {The Suess Effect is a term which has come to signify the decrease in 14C in atmospheric CO2 owing to admixture of CO2 produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. This term is here extended, as a concept, to the shifts in isotopic ratio of both 13C and 14C in any reservoir of the carbon cycle owing to anthropogenic activities. To explain this generalized Suess Effect a four reservoir global model of the natural carbon cycle is developed in which isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay are fully taken into account. The model includes the cases in which the deep ocean is treated either as a single undifferentiated box model reservoir or is vertically differentiated with eddy diffusion governing the transport of carbon. Also, the governing equations are expressed with sufficient generality to apply simultaneously to both rare isotopes. In so far as possible, the model is expressed without approximation of the isotopic processes even though this leads to non-linear differential equations to describe the rates of change of rare isotopic carbon within carbon reservoirs. Linear approximations also developed and solved using the method of Laplace transforms. The sensitivity of the predicted Suess Effects to uncertainties in the assigned values of the model parameters is investigated in detail, including estimates of some of the effects of linearizing the governing equations. The approximation of Stuiver, in which the atmospheric Suess Effect is assumed to be 0.018 times the corresponding effect for 14C, is examined in detail and shown to arise when both isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay are left out of the model. This approximation, although correct as to order of magnitude, is found to be too imprecise to be recommended in modeling studies. As found in previous work, the predicted atmospheric Suess Effect for 13C for a given airborne fraction of industrial CO2 is of similar magnitude whether the land biosphere has been a net source or sink of carbon during recent times. On the other hand, the corresponding effect for a surface ocean water is considerably smaller than otherwise if the land biosphere has been a source of CO2 instead of a sink. The model is thus useful in indicating the need to consider isotopes in several reservoirs simultaneously. Although the emphasis is on formulating models rather than surveying and interpreting data, observational data are summarized and compared with model predictions. The oceanic data are seen to be too meager as yet to help settle the question of biospheric response to man's activities. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {A decrease in the 13C/12C ratio of atmospheric CO2 has been documented by direct observations since 1978 and from ice core measurements since the industrial revolution. This decrease, known as the 13C-Suess effect, is driven primarily by the input of fossil fuel-derived CO2 but is also sensitive to land and ocean carbon cycling and uptake. Using updated records, we show that no plausible combination of sources and sinks of CO2 from fossil fuel, land, and oceans can explain the observed 13C-Suess effect unless an increase has occurred in the 13C/12C isotopic discrimination of land photosynthesis. A trend toward greater discrimination under higher CO2 levels is broadly consistent with tree ring studies over the past century, with field and chamber experiments, and with geological records of C3 plants at times of altered atmospheric CO2, but increasing discrimination has not previously been included in studies of long-term atmospheric 13C/12C measurements. We further show that the inferred discrimination increase of 0.014 ± 0.007‰ ppm−1 is largely explained by photorespiratory and mesophyll effects. This result implies that, at the global scale, land plants have regulated their stomatal conductance so as to allow the CO2 partial pressure within stomatal cavities and their intrinsic water use efficiency to increase in nearly constant proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration.},

abstract = {Interannual variability in biosphere-atmosphere exchange of CO 2 is driven by a diverse range of biotic and abiotic factors. Replicating this variability thus represents the ‘acid test' for terrestrial biosphere models. Although such models are commonly used to project responses to both normal and anomalous variability in climate, they are rarely tested explicitly against inter-annual variability in observations. Herein, using standardized data from the North American Carbon Program, we assess the performance of 16 terrestrial biosphere models and 3 remote sensing prod- ucts against long-term measurements of biosphere-atmosphere CO 2 exchange made with eddy-covariance flux tow- ers at 11 forested sites in North America. Instead of focusing on model-data agreement we take a systematic, variability-oriented approach and show that although the models tend to reproduce the mean magnitude of the observed annual flux variability, they fail to reproduce the timing. Large biases in modeled annual means are evident for all models. Observed interannual variability is found to commonly be on the order of magnitude of the mean fluxes. None of the models consistently reproduce observed interannual variability within measurement uncertainty. Underrepresentation of variability in spring phenology, soil thaw and snowpack melting, and difficulties in repro- ducing the lagged response to extreme climatic events are identified as systematic errors, common to all models included in this study.},

abstract = {The global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing1–3, offsetting roughly a third of anthropogenic CO2 released into the atmosphere each decade1, and thus serving to slow4 the growth of atmospheric CO2. It has been suggested that a CO2-induced long-term increase in global photosynthesis, a process known as CO2 fertilization, is responsible for a large proportion of the current terrestrial carbon sink4–7. The estimated magnitude of the historic increase in photosynthesis as result of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, however, differs by an order of magnitude between long-term proxies and terrestrial biosphere models7–13. Here we quantify the historic effect of CO2 on global photosynthesis by identifying an emergent constraint14–16 that combines terrestrial biosphere models with global carbon budget estimates. Our analysis suggests that CO2 fertilization increased global annual photosynthesis by 11.85 ± 1.4%, or 13.98 ± 1.63 petagrams carbon (mean ± 95% confidence interval) between 1981 and 2020. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of the historic sensitivity of global photosynthesis to CO2, and highlight the large impact anthropogenic emissions have had on ecosystems worldwide.},

abstract = {Life on Earth comes in many forms, but all life-forms share a common element in carbon. It is the basic building block of biology, and by trapping radiation it also plays an important role in maintaining the Earth's atmosphere at a temperature hospitable to life. Like all matter, carbon can neither be created nor destroyed, but instead is continuously exchanged between ecosystems and the environment through a complex combination of physics and biology. In recent decades, these exchanges have led to an increased accumulation of carbon on the land surface: the terrestrial carbon sink. Over the past 10 years (2007–2016) the sink has removed an estimated 3.61 Pg C year −1 from the atmosphere, which amounts to 33.7% of total anthropogenic emissions from industrial activity and land-use change. This sink constitutes a valuable ecosystem service, which has significantly slowed the rate of climate change. Here, we review current understanding of the underlying biological processes that govern the terrestrial carbon sink and their dependence on climate, atmospheric composition, and human interventions.},

The determination of exchangeable ammonium, NO3 -, and N02 - in soils is complicated by the rapid biological transformations that may occur to change the amounts and forms of inorganic N in the sample. Colorimetric methods have been widely used for analysis of inorganic forms of N in soil extracts because of their sensitivity, speed, and ease of use. Microdiffusion methods for determination of inorganic forms of N offer the advantages of low cost and simplicity. The amount of N added in the standard solutions should encompass the range of inorganic N in the soil extracts. The determination of inorganic forms of N by specific ion electrodes would, on first consideration, be quite attractive when compared with manual distillation or colorimetric methods.},

abstract = {Intensification of the global hydrological cycle, ranging from larger individual precipitation events to more extreme multiyear droughts, has the potential to cause widespread alterations in ecosystem structure and function. With evidence that the incidence of extreme precipitation years (defined statistically from historical precipitation records) is increasing, there is a clear need to identify ecosystems that are most vulnerable to these changes and understand why some ecosystems are more sensitive to extremes than others. To date, opportunistic studies of naturally occurring extreme precipitation years, combined with results from a relatively small number of experiments, have provided limited mechanistic understanding of differences in ecosystem sensitivity, suggesting that new approaches are needed. Coordinated distributed experiments (CDEs) arrayed across multiple ecosystem types and focused on water can enhance our understanding of differential ecosystem sensitivity to precipitation extremes, but there are many design challenges to overcome (e.g., cost, comparability, standardization). Here, we evaluate contemporary experimental approaches for manipulating precipitation under field conditions to inform the design of ‘Drought-Net', a relatively low-cost CDE that simulates extreme precipitation years. A common method for imposing both dry and wet years is to alter each ambient precipitation event. We endorse this approach for imposing extreme precipitation years because it simultaneously alters other precipitation characteristics (i.e., event size) consistent with natural precipitation patterns. However, we do not advocate applying identical treatment levels at all sites – a common approach to standardization in CDEs. This is because precipitation variability varies >fivefold globally resulting in a wide range of ecosystem-specific thresholds for defining extreme precipitation years. For CDEs focused on precipitation extremes, treatments should be based on each site's past climatic characteristics. This approach, though not often used by ecologists, allows ecological responses to be directly compared across disparate ecosystems and climates, facilitating process-level understanding of ecosystem sensitivity to precipitation extremes.},

abstract = {Fine roots (defined by a maximum diameter of 2 mm) and assimilatory organs are the compartments which rotate carbon much faster than any other tree part. We focused on quantification of fine roots in young European beech and Norway spruce trees growing under the same ecological conditions. Standing stock of fine roots was estimated by soil coring during 2009 - 2012. Fine root production was established by the in-growth bag method. Standing stock and productions of fine roots were comparable in both tree species. The quantity of fine root biomass (at a soil depth of 0 -50 cm) varied inter-annually between 6.08 and 7.41 t per ha in the beech and from 5.10 to 6.49 t per ha in the spruce stand. Annual production of fine roots (soil depth of 0 - 30 cm) was between 1.11 and 1.63 t ha-1 in beech and between 0.95 and 1.54 t.ha-1 in spruce. We found that fine root standing stock at the beginning of each growing season was related to climatic conditions in the previous year. Annual fine root production was influenced by the climatic situation of the current year. In general, a maximum standing stock of fine roots as well as a relatively slow fine root turnover is expected in young forest stands. Whereas production of fine roots prevailed over mortality in a favorable year (sufficiency of precipitations and slightly above-average temperatures in 2010), there was a reverse situation in an unfavorable year (drought episodes in 2011). We concluded that although both forest types represented contrasting turnovers of assimilatory organs (once a year and once in 5 years in beech and spruce respectively), fine root turnover rates were very similar (approx. once per four years).},

abstract = {Ecosystems are projected to face extreme high temperatures more frequently in the near future. Various biotic coping strategies exist to prevent heat stress. Controlled experiments have recently provided evidence for continued transpiration in woody plants during high air temperatures, even when photosynthesis is inhibited. Such a decoupling of photosynthesis and transpiration would represent an effective strategy ('known as leaf or canopy cooling') to prevent lethal leaf temperatures. At the ecosystem scale, continued transpiration might dampen the development and propagation of heat extremes despite further desiccating soils. However, at the ecosystem scale, evidence for the occurrence of this decoupling is still limited. Here, we aim to investigate this mechanism using eddy-covariance data of thirteen woody ecosystems located in Australia and a causal graph discovery algorithm. Working at half-hourly time resolution, we find evidence for a decoupling of photosynthesis and transpiration in four ecosystems which can be classified as Mediterranean woodlands. The decoupling occurred at air temperatures above 35 °C. At the nine other investigated woody sites, we found that vegetation CO2 exchange remained coupled to transpiration at the observed high air temperatures. Ecosystem characteristics suggest that the canopy energy balance plays a crucial role in determining the occurrence of a decoupling. Our results highlight the value of causal-inference approaches for the analysis of complex physiological processes. With regard to projected increasing temperatures and especially extreme events in future climates, further vegetation types might be pushed to threatening canopy temperatures. Our findings suggest that the coupling of leaf-level photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, common in land surface schemes, may need be re-examined when applied to high-temperature events.},

abstract = {Plants can change soil biology, chemistry and structure in ways that alter subsequent plant growth. This process, referred to as plant-soil feedback (PSF), has been suggested to provide mechanisms for plant diversity, succession and invasion. Here we use three meta-analytical models: a mixed model and two Bayes models, one correcting for sampling dependence and one correcting for sampling and hierarchical dependence (delta-splitting model) to test these hypotheses. All three models showed that PSFs have medium to large negative effects on plant growth, and especially grass growth, the life form for which we had the most data. This supports the hypothesis that PSFs, through negative frequency dependence, maintain plant diversity, especially in grasslands. PSFs were also large and negative for annuals and natives, but the delta-splitting model indicated that more studies are needed for these results to be conclusive. Our results support the hypotheses that PSFs encourage successional replacements and plant invasions. Most studies were performed using monocultures of grassland species in greenhouse conditions. Future research should examine PSFs in plant communities, non-grassland systems and field conditions.},

abstract = {Abiotic stresses (such as salinity, drought, cold, heat, mineral deficiency and metals/metalloids) have become major threats to the global agricultural production. These stresses in isolation and/or combination control plant growth, development and productivity by causing physiological disorders, ion toxicity, and hormonal and nutritional imbalances. Some soil microorganisms like arbuscular mycorhizal fungi (AMF) inhabit the rhizosphere and develop a symbiotic relationship with the roots of most plant species. AMF can significantly improve resistance of host plants to varied biotic and abiotic stresses. Taking into account recent literature, this paper: (a) overviews major abiotic stresses and introduces the arbuscular mycorrhizae symbiosis (b) appraises the role and underlying major mechanisms of AMF in plant tolerance to major abiotic stresses including salinity, drought, temperature regimes (cold and heat), nutrient-deficiency, and metal/metalloids; (c) discusses major molecular mechanisms potentially involved in AMF-mediated plant-abiotic stress tolerance; and finally (d) highlights major aspects for future work in the current direction.},

abstract = {Carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$13C) in C3 woody plants is a key variable for the study of photosynthesis. Yet how $\Delta$13C varies at decadal scales, and across regions, and how it is related to gross primary production (GPP), are still incompletely understood. Here we address these questions by implementing a new $\Delta$13C modelling capability in the land-surface model JULES incorporating both photorespiratory and mesophyll-conductance fractionations. We test the ability of four leaf-internal CO2 concentration models embedded in JULES to reproduce leaf and tree-ring (TR) carbon isotopic data. We show that all the tested models tend to overestimate average $\Delta$13C values, and to underestimate interannual variability in $\Delta$13C. This is likely because they ignore the effects of soil water stress on stomatal behavior. Variations in post-photosynthetic isotopic fractionations across species, sites and years, may also partly explain the discrepancies between predicted and TR-derived $\Delta$13C values. Nonetheless, the “least-cost” (Prentice) model shows the lowest biases with the isotopic measurements, and lead to improved predictions of canopy-level carbon and water fluxes. Overall, modelled $\Delta$13C trends vary strongly between regions during the recent (1979–2016) historical period but stay nearly constant when averaged over the globe. Photorespiratory and mesophyll effects modulate the simulated global $\Delta$13C trend by 0.0015 ± 0.005‰ and –0.0006 ± 0.001‰ ppm−1, respectively. These predictions contrast with previous findings based on atmospheric carbon isotope measurements. Predicted $\Delta$13C and GPP tend to be negatively correlated in wet-humid and cold regions, and in tropical African forests, but positively related elsewhere. The negative correlation between $\Delta$13C and GPP is partly due to the strong dominant influences of temperature on GPP and vapor pressure deficit on $\Delta$13C in those forests. Our results demonstrate that the combined analysis of $\Delta$13C and GPP can help understand the drivers of photosynthesis changes in different climatic regions.},

abstract = {Atmospheric aridity and drought both influence physiological function in plant leaves, but their relative contributions to changes in the ratio of leaf internal to ambient partial pressure of CO2 ($\chi$) – an index of adjustments in both stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate to environmental conditions – are difficult to disentangle. Many stomatal models predicting $\chi$ include the influence of only one of these drivers. In particular, the least-cost optimality hypothesis considers the effect of atmospheric demand for water on $\chi$ but does not predict how soils with reduced water further influence $\chi$, potentially leading to an overestimation of $\chi$ under dry conditions. Here, we use a large network of stable carbon isotope measurements in C3 woody plants to examine the acclimated response of $\chi$ to soil water stress. We estimate the ratio of cost factors for carboxylation and transpiration ($\beta$) expected from the theory to explain the variance in the data, and investigate the responses of $\beta$ (and thus $\chi$) to soil water content and suction across seed plant groups, leaf phenological types and regions. Overall, $\beta$ decreases linearly with soil drying, implying that the cost of water transport along the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum increases as water available in the soil decreases. However, despite contrasting hydraulic strategies, the stomatal responses of angiosperms and gymnosperms to soil water tend to converge, consistent with the optimality theory. The prediction of $\beta$ as a simple, empirical function of soil water significantly improves $\chi$ predictions by up to 6.3 ± 2.3% (mean ± SD of adjusted-R2) over 1980–2018 and results in a reduction of around 2% of mean $\chi$ values across the globe. Our results highlight the importance of soil water status on stomatal functions and plant water-use efficiency, and suggest the implementation of trait-based hydraulic functions into the model to account for soil water stress.},

abstract = {Our meta-analysis of 126 nitrogen addition experiments evaluated nitrogen (N) limitation of net primary production (NPP) in terrestrial ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that N limitation is widespread among biomes and influenced by geography and climate. We used the response ratio (R ffi ANPPN/ANPPctrl) of aboveground plant growth in fertilized to control plots and found that most ecosystems are nitrogen limited with an average 29% growth response to nitrogen (i.e., R ¼ 1.29). The response ratio was significant within temperate forests (R ¼ 1.19), tropical forests (R ¼ 1.60), temperate grasslands (R ¼ 1.53), tropical grasslands (R ¼ 1.26), wetlands (R ¼ 1.16), and tundra (R ¼ 1.35), but not deserts. Eight tropical forest studies had been conducted on very young volcanic soils in Hawaii, and this subgroup was strongly N limited (R ¼ 2.13), which resulted in a negative correlation between forest R and latitude. The degree of N limitation in the remainder of the tropical forest studies (R ¼ 1.20) was comparable to that of temperate forests, and when the young Hawaiian subgroup was excluded, forest R did not vary with latitude. Grassland response increased with latitude, but was independent of temperature and precipitation. These results suggest that the global N and C cycles interact strongly and that geography can mediate ecosystem response to N within certain biome types.},

abstract = {Ecologists and evolutionary biologists rely on an increasingly sophisticated set of statistical tools to describe complex natural systems. One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models. Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.},

abstract = {Plants interact simultaneously with each other and with soil biota, yet the relative importance of competition vs. plant–soil feedback (PSF) on plant performance is poorly understood. Using a meta-analysis of 38 published studies and 150 plant species, we show that effects of interspecific competition (either growing plants with a competitor or singly, or comparing inter- vs. intraspeci- fic competition) and PSF (comparing home vs. away soil, live vs. sterile soil, or control vs. fungi- cide-treated soil) depended on treatments but were predominantly negative, broadly comparable in magnitude, and additive or synergistic. Stronger competitors experienced more negative PSF than weaker competitors when controlling for density (inter- to intraspecific competition), suggest- ing that PSF could prevent competitive dominance and promote coexistence. When competition was measured against plants growing singly, the strength of competition overwhelmed PSF, indi- cating that the relative importance of PSF may depend not only on neighbour identity but also density. We evaluate how competition and PSFs might interact across resource gradients; PSF will likely strengthen competitive interactions in high resource environments and enhance facilitative interactions in low-resource environments. Finally, we provide a framework for filling key knowl- edge gaps and advancing our understanding of how these biotic interactions influence community structure.},

Potential evaporation is defined as theevaporation that would occur from a hypothetical saturated surface,with radiative properties similar to those of the whole area, and smallenough that the excess moisture flux does not modify thecharacteristics of the CBL. It is shown that the equilibrium rate ofpotential evaporation is given by Ep0=$\alpha$E0,where E0 is the equilibrium evaporation (radiative termof the Penman formula), and $\alpha$ is a coefficient similar to thePriestley-Taylor coefficient. Its expression is ?=1+[1/(?+1)](⟨??⟩/??), where ⟨??⟩ is the areal surface resistance, ra is the localaerodynamic resistance, and $\epsilon$ is the dimensionless slope of thesaturation specific humidity at the temperature of the air. Itscalculated value is around 1 for any saturated surface surrounded bywater, about 1.3 for saturated grass surrounded by well-watered grassand can be greater than 3 over saturated forest surrounded by forest.The formulation obtained provides a theoretical basis to the overallmean value of 1.26, empirically found by Priestley and Taylor for thecoefficient $\alpha$. Examining, at the light of this formulation, thecomplementary relationship between potential and actual evaporation(as proposed by Bouchet and Morton), it appears that the sum ofthese two magnitudes is not a constant at equilibrium, but depends onthe value of the areal surface resistance},

abstract = {Abstract. The nitrogen (N) cycle has the potential to regulate climate change through its influence on carbon (C) sequestration. Although extensive research has explored whether or not progressive N limitation (PNL) occurs under CO2 enrichment, a comprehensive assessment of the processes that regulate PNL is still lacking. Here, we quantitatively synthesized the responses of all major processes and pools in the terrestrial N cycle with meta-analysis of CO2 experimental data available in the literature. The results showed that CO2 enrichment significantly increased N sequestration in the plant and litter pools but not in the soil pool, partially supporting one of the basic assumptions in the PNL hypothesis that elevated CO2 results in more N sequestered in organic pools. However, CO2 enrichment significantly increased the N influx via biological N fixation and the loss via N2O emission, but decreased the N efflux via leaching. In addition, no general diminished CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth was observed over time up to the longest experiment of 13 years. Overall, our analyses suggest that the extra N supply by the increased biological N fixation and decreased leaching may potentially alleviate PNL under elevated CO2 conditions in spite of the increases in plant N sequestration and N2O emission. Moreover, our syntheses indicate that CO2 enrichment increases soil ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3−) ratio. The changed NH4+/NO3− ratio and subsequent biological processes may result in changes in soil microenvironments, above-belowground community structures and associated interactions, which could potentially affect the terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. In addition, our data synthesis suggests that more long-term studies, especially in regions other than temperate ones, are needed for comprehensive assessments of the PNL hypothesis.},

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of plant photosynthetic response is needed to reliably predict changes in terrestrial carbon (C) gain under conditions of chronically elevated atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Here, using 2,683 observations from 240 jour- nal articles, we conducted a global meta-analysis to reveal effects of N addition on 14 photosynthesis-related traits and affecting moderators. We found that across 320 terrestrial plant species, leaf N was enhanced comparably on mass basis (Nmass , +18.4%) and area basis (Narea, +14.3%), with no changes in specific leaf area or leaf mass per area. Total leaf area (TLA) was increased significantly, as indicated by the in- creases in total leaf biomass (+46.5%), leaf area per plant (+29.7%), and leaf area index (LAI, +24.4%). To a lesser extent than for TLA, N addition significantly enhanced leaf photosynthetic rate per area (Aarea, +12.6%), stomatal conductance (gs, +7.5%), and transpiration rate (E, +10.5%). The responses of Aarea were positively related with that of gs, with no changes in instantaneous water-use efficiency and only slight in- creases in long-term water-use efficiency (+2.5%) inferred from 13C composition. The responses of traits depended on biological, experimental, and environmental moder- ators. As experimental duration and N load increased, the responses of LAI and Aarea diminished while that of E increased significantly. The observed patterns of increases in both TLA and E indicate that N deposition will increase the amount of water used by plants. Taken together, N deposition will enhance gross photosynthetic C gain of the terrestrial plants while increasing their water loss to the atmosphere, but the effects on C gain might diminish over time and that on plant water use would be am- plified if N deposition persists},

abstract = {Legumes have developed a unique way to interact with bacteria: in addition to preventing infection from pathogenic bacteria like any other plant, legumes also developed a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with one gender of soil bacteria: rhizobium. This interaction leads to the development of a new root organ, the nodule, where the differentiated bacteria fix for the plant the atmospheric dinitrogen (atmN 2 ). In exchange, the symbiont will benefit from a permanent source of carbon compounds, products of the photosynthesis. The substantial amounts of fixed carbon dioxide dedicated to the symbiont imposed to the plant a tight regulation of the nodulation process to balance carbon and nitrogen incomes and outcomes. Climate change including the increase of the concentration of the atmospheric carbon dioxide is going to modify the rates of plant photosynthesis, the balance between nitrogen and carbon, and, as a consequence, the regulatory mechanisms of the nodulation process. This review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms controlling carbon/nitrogen balances in the context of legume nodulation and discusses how the change in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration could affect nodulation efficiency.},

abstract = {The principles, equipment and procedures for measuring leaf and canopy gas exchange have been described previously as has chlorophyll fluorescence. Simultaneous measurement of the responses of leaf gas exchange and modulated chlorophyll fluorescence to light and CO2 concentration now provide a means to determine a wide range of key biochemical and biophysical limitations on photosynthesis in vivo. Here the mathematical frameworks and practical procedures for determining these parameters in vivo are consolidated. Leaf CO2 uptake (A) versus intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) curves may now be routinely obtained from commercial gas exchange systems. The potential pitfalls, and means to avoid these, are examined. Calculation of in vivo maximum rates of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation (Vc,max), electron transport driving regeneration of RuBP (J max), and triose-phosphate utilization (VTPU) are explained; these three parameters are now widely assumed to represent the major limitations to light-saturated photosynthesis. Precision in determining these in intact leaves is improved by the simultaneous measurement of electron transport via modulated chlorophyll fluorescence. The A/Ci response also provides a simple practical method for quantifying the limitation that stomata impose on CO2 assimilation. Determining the rate of photorespiratory release of oxygen (R1) has previously only been possible by isotopic methods, now, by combining gas exchange and fluorescence measurements, R1 may be determined simply and routinely in the field. The physical diffusion of CO2 from the intercellular air space to the site of Rubisco in C3 leaves has long been suspected of being a limitation on photosynthesis, but it has commonly been ignored because of the lack of a practical method for its determination. Again combining gas exchange and fluorescence provides a means to determine mesophyll conductance. This method is described and provides insights into the magnitude and basis of this limitation.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis is an important remaining opportunity for further improvement in the genetic yield potential of our major crops. Measurement, analysis, and improvement of leaf CO 2 assimilation ( A) have focused largely on photosynthetic rates under light-saturated steady-state conditions. However, in modern crop canopies of several leaf layers, light is rarely constant, and the majority of leaves experience marked light fluctuations throughout the day. It takes several minutes for photosynthesis to regain efficiency in both sun-shade and shade-sun transitions, costing a calculated 10–40% of potential crop CO 2 assimilation. Transgenic manipulations to accelerate the adjustment in sun-shade transitions have already shown a substantial productivity increase in field trials. Here, we explore means to further accelerate these adjustments and minimize these losses through transgenic manipulation, gene editing, and exploitation of natural variation. Measurement andanalysis of photosynthesis in sun-shade and shade-sun transitions are explained. Factors limiting speeds of adjustment and how they could be modified to effect improved efficiency are reviewed, specifically nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), Rubisco activation, and stomatal responses.},

abstract = {Photosynthetically derived carbon (C) is allocated belowground, allowing plants to obtain nutrients. However, less is known about the amount of nutrients acquired relative to the C allocated belowground, which is referred to as C efficiency for nutrient acquisition (CENA). Here, we examined how C efficiency for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) acquisition varied between ryegrass ( Lolium perenne ) and clover ( Trifolium repens ) with and without P fertilization. A continuous 13 C-labeling method was applied to track belowground C allocation. Both species allocated nearly half of belowground C to rhizosphere respiration (49%), followed by root biomass (37%), and rhizodeposition (14%). With regard to N and P, CENA was higher for clover than for ryegrass, which remained higher after accounting for relatively low C costs associated with biological N 2 fixation. Phosphorus fertilization increased the C efficiency for P acquisition but decreased the C efficiency for N acquisition. A higher CENA for N and P in clover may be attributed to the greater rhizosphere priming on soil organic matter decomposition. Increased P availability with P fertilization could induce lower C allocation for P uptake but exacerbate soil N limitation, thereby making N uptake less C efficient. Overall, our study revealed that species-specific belowground C allocation and nutrient uptake efficiency depend on which nutrient is limited.},

abstract = {Global warming potentially alters the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, likely feeding back to further climate warming. However, how the ecosystem C cycle responds and feeds back to warming remains unclear. Here we used a meta-analysis approach to quantify the response ratios of 18 variables of the ecosystem C cycle to experimental warming and evaluated ecosystem C-cycle feedback to climate warming. Our results showed that warming stimulated gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) by 15.7%, net primary production (NPP) by 4.4%, and plant C pools from above- and belowground parts by 6.8% and 7.0%, respectively. Experimental warming accelerated litter mass loss by 6.8%, soil respiration by 9.0%, and dissolved organic C leaching by 12.1%. In addition, the responses of some of those variables to experimental warming differed among the ecosystem types. Our results demonstrated that the stimulation of plant-derived C influx basically offset the increase in warming-induced efflux and resulted in insignificant changes in litter and soil C content, indicating that climate warming may not trigger strong positive C-climate feedback from terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, the increase in plant C storage together with the slight but not statistically significant decrease of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) across ecosystems suggests that terrestrial ecosystems might be a weak C sink rather than a C source under global climate warming. Our results are also potentially useful for parameterizing and benchmarking land surface models in terms of C cycle responses to climate warming.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis responds quickly to changes in light, increasing with incoming photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) until the leaves become light saturated. This instantaneous response to PPFD, which is widely studied and incorporated into models of photosynthesis, is overlaid on non-instantaneous photosynthetic changes resulting from the acclimation of plants to average PPFD over intermediate timescales of a week to months (PPFD ¯). Such photosynthetic light acclimation is not typically incorporated into models, due to the lack of observational constraints. Here, we use eddy covariance observations from globally distributed and automated sensor networks, along with photosynthesis estimates from nine terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), to quantify and assess photosynthetic acclimation to light in natural environments. We also use recent theoretical developments to incorporate light acclimation in a TBM. Our results show widespread light acclimation of ecosystem photosynthesis. On average, a 1 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1 increase in PPFD ¯ 10 (ten-day average PPFD) leads to a 0.031 ± 0.013 $\mu$mol C m−2 s−1 increase in the maximum photosynthetic assimilation rate (Amax), with croplands having stronger acclimation rates than grasslands and forests. Our analysis shows that the TBMs examined either neglect or substantially underestimate light acclimation. By updating a TBM to include photosynthetic acclimation, successfully reproducing the PPFD ¯ 10–Amax relationship, we provide a robust method for the incorporation of photosynthetic light acclimation in future models.},

abstract = {Plants invest a considerable amount of leaf nitrogen in the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), forming a strong coupling of nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity. Variability in the nitrogen-photosynthesis relationship indicates different nitrogen use strategies of plants (i.e., the fraction nitrogen allocated to RuBisCO; fLNR), however, the reason for this remains unclear as widely different nitrogen use strategies are adopted in photosynthesis models. Here, we use a comprehensive database of in situ observations, a remote sensing product of leaf chlorophyll and ancillary climate and soil data, to examine the global distribution in fLNR using a random forest model. We find global fLNR is 18.2 ± 6.2%, with its variation largely driven by negative dependence on leaf mass per area and positive dependence on leaf phosphorus. Some climate and soil factors (i.e., light, atmospheric dryness, soil pH, and sand) have considerable positive influences on fLNR regionally. This study provides insight into the nitrogen-photosynthesis relationship of plants globally and an improved understanding of the global distribution of photosynthetic potential.},

abstract = {Temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere cover an area of about 2 × 107 square kilometres and act as a substantial carbon sink (0.6-0.7 petagrams of carbon per year). Although forest expansion following agricultural abandonment is certainly responsible for an important fraction of this carbon sink activity, the additional effects on the carbon balance of established forests of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures, changes in management practices and nitrogen deposition are difficult to disentangle, despite an extensive network of measurement stations. The relevance of this measurement effort has also been questioned, because spot measurements fail to take into account the role of disturbances, either natural (fire, pests, windstorms) or anthropogenic (forest harvesting). Here we show that the temporal dynamics following stand-replacing disturbances do indeed account for a very large fraction of the overall variability in forest carbon sequestration. After the confounding effects of disturbance have been factored out, however, forest net carbon sequestration is found to be overwhelmingly driven by nitrogen deposition, largely the result of anthropogenic activities. The effect is always positive over the range of nitrogen deposition covered by currently available data sets, casting doubts on the risk of widespread ecosystem nitrogen saturation under natural conditions. The results demonstrate that mankind is ultimately controlling the carbon balance of temperate and boreal forests, either directly (through forest management) or indirectly (through nitrogen deposition). {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Aim The influence of soil properties on photosynthetic traits in higher plants is poorly quantified in comparison with that of climate. We address this situation by quantifying the unique and joint contributions to global leaf-trait variation from soils and climate. Location Terrestrial ecosystems world-wide. Methods Using a trait dataset comprising 1509 species from 288 sites, with climate and soil data derived from global datasets, we quantified the effects of 20 soil and 26 climate variables on light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Aarea ), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf nitrogen and phosphorus (Narea and Parea ) and specific leaf area (SLA) using mixed regression models and multivariate analyses. Results Soil variables were stronger predictors of leaf traits than climatic vari- ables, except for SLA.On average, Narea , Parea and Aarea increased and SLA decreased with increasing soil pH and with increasing site aridity. gs declined and Parea increased with soil available P (Pavail ). Narea was unrelated to total soil N. Joint effects of soil and climate dominated over their unique effects on Narea and Parea , while unique effects of soils dominated for Aarea and gs . Path analysis indicated that variation in Aarea reflected the combined independent influences ofNarea and gs , the former promoted by high pH and aridity and the latter by low Pavail . Main conclusions Three environmental variables were key for explaining vari- ation in leaf traits: soil pH and Pavail , and the climatic moisture index (the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration). Although the reliability of global soil datasets lags behind that of climate datasets, our results nonetheless provide compelling evidence that both can be jointly used in broad-scale analyses, and that effects uniquely attributable to soil properties are important determinants of leaf photosynthetic traits and rates. A significant future challenge is to better disentan- gle the covarying physiological, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that underpin},

The plants were grown hydroponically in growth chambers with a 14-h photoperiod (1000 [mu]mol quanta m-2 s-1) and a day/night temperature of 25/20[deg]C. From the 28th to 70th d after germination, the plants were exposed to two CO2 partial pressures, namely 36 and 100 Pa. The CO2 enrichment increased the final biomass, but this was caused by a stimulation of the growth rate during the first week of the exposure to elevated CO2 partial pressures. The disappearance of the initial stimulation of the growth rate was associated with a decreased leaf area ratio. Furthermore, CO2 enrichment decreased the investment of N in the leaf blades, whereas the N allocation into the leaf sheaths and roots increased. Thus, the decrease in leaf N content by CO2 enrichment was not due to dilution of N caused by a relative increase in the plant biomass but was due to the change in N allocation at the whole-plant level. We conclude that the growth responses of rice to CO2 enrichment are mainly controlled by leaf area expansion and N allocation into leaf blades at the whole-plant level.},

abstract = {The accumulation of species-specific enemies around adults is hypothesized to maintain plant diversity by limiting the recruitment of conspecific seedlings relative to heterospecific seedlings. Although previous studies in forested ecosystems have documented patterns consistent with the process of negative feedback, these studies are unable to address which classes of enemies (for example, pathogens, invertebrates, mammals) exhibit species-specific effects strong enough to generate negative feedback, and whether negative feedback at the level of the individual tree is sufficient to influence community-wide forest composition. Here we use fully reciprocal shade-house and field experiments to test whether the performance of conspecific tree seedlings (relative to heterospecific seedlings) is reduced when grown in the presence of enemies associated with adult trees. Both experiments provide strong evidence for negative plant-soil feedback mediated by soil biota. In contrast, above-ground enemies (mammals, foliar herbivores and foliar pathogens) contributed little to negative feedback observed in the field. In both experiments, we found that tree species that showed stronger negative feedback were less common as adults in the forest community, indicating that susceptibility to soil biota may determine species relative abundance in these tropical forests. Finally, our simulation models confirm that the strength of local negative feedback that we measured is sufficient to produce the observed community-wide patterns in tree-species relative abundance. Our findings indicate that plant-soil feedback is an important mechanism that can maintain species diversity and explain patterns of tree-species relative abundance in tropical forests.},

abstract = {The accuracy of soil water content (WC) interpretation from satellites and its application in hydrological modelling is dependent on our understanding of the effects of field-scale surface soil properties on soil WC variability. Soil texture, surface roughness and surface residue were evaluated for their influence on soil WC variability with data obtained from satellite ground verification sampling near Carman, Manitoba, within a 28 km2 area. Over the course of five selected dates from 23 April to 18 May 2008, soil WC and other physical variables were obtained in 38 agricultural fields covering three distinct soil textural classifications. Within each field, at each of 16 sampling locations, four individual soil WC measurements were taken, including sampling points with and without the influence of crop residue left on the soil surface. A principal component analysis and multiple linear regression both identified soil texture as the primary physical process controlling variability in soil WC and coefficient of variation (CV) among fields during the campaign. Residue cover was also a significant factor representing a second principal component that explained 37% of variability in average soil WC and contributed to 31% of variability in CV. Whereas soil texture predominated in soil WC and CV on most sampling dates, residue cover was of equal significance as texture in dry soils. This study identified specific effects of tillage and residue management contributing to field-scale soil WC variability that could contribute significant improvements to interpretation of remotely sensed soil WC and subsequent scaling efforts over agricultural regions. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Since nitrogen availability can depress symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and nitrogen fixation can make plant growth independent of soil nitrogen availability but is energetically costly, it is unclear how allocation patterns in nitrogen-fixing species should respond to variation in soil nitrogen availability. We examined the effect of nitrogen source and concentration on the growth and allocation patterns in the nitrogen-fixing shrub Alnus viridis subsp. crispa (Aiton) Turrill. Plants were grown with either NH 4 + -N or NO 3 – -N at a range of low N concentrations, from 0 to 2 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L –1 , and either inoculated with Frankia or not. Plants without nodules had 25.l% lower biomass and had double the allocation to roots at all but the 2 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L –1 nitrogen concentration. Even though nodulated plants increased growth with nitrogen concentration, allocation to roots as a fraction of total biomass did not vary in these plants, suggesting increased growth resulted from more efficient nitrogen acquisition. Allocation to roots was a significant predictor of plant growth in non-nodulated plants (r 2 = 0.318, for linear least squares fit with log mass) but not for nodulated plants (r 2 = 0.108). As nitrogen concentrations increased, allocation to nodules, specific nodule numbers, and the proportion of nitrogen fixed by the plants decreased, demonstrating a shift to soil nitrogen use.},

abstract = {The role of mycorrhizal fungi in acquisition of mineral nutrients by host plants is examined for three groups of mycorrhizas. These are; the ectomycorrhizas (ECM), the ericoid mycorrhizas (EM), and the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas (VAM). Mycorrhizal infection may affect the mineral nutrition of the host plant directly by enhancing plant growth through nutrient acquisition by the fungus, or indirectly by modifying transpiration rates and the composition of rhizosphere microflora. A capacity for the external hyphae to take up and deliver nutrients to the plant has been demonstrated for the following nutrients and mycorrhizas; P (VAM, EM, ECM), NH4+ (VAM, EM, ECM), NO3- (ECM), K (VAM, ECM), Ca (VAM, EM), SO42- (VAM), Cu (VAM), Zn (VAM) and Fe (EM). In experimental chambers, the external hyphae of VAM can deliver up to 80% of plant P, 25% of plant N, 10% of plant K, 25% of plant Zn and 60% of plant Cu. Knowledge of the role of mycorrhiza in the uptake of nutrients other than P and N is limited because definitive studies are few, especially for the ECM. Although further quantification is required, it is feasible that the external hyphae may provide a significant delivery system for N, K, Cu and Zn in addition to P in many soils. Proposals that ECM and VAM fungi contribute substantially to the Mg, B and Fe nutrition of the host plant have not been substantiated. ECM and EM fungi produce ectoenzymes which provide host plants with the potential to access organic N and P forms that are normally unavailable to VAM fungi or to non mycorrhizal roots. The relative contribution of these nutrient sources requires quantification in the field. Further basic research, including the quantification of nutrient uptake and transport by fungal hyphae in soil and regulation at the fungal-plant interface, is essential to support the selection and utilization of mycorrhizal fungi on a commercial scale. {\textcopyright} 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The productivity of ecosystems and their capacity to support life depends on access to reactive nitrogen (N). Over the past century, humans have more than doubled the global supply of reactive N through industrial and agricultural activities. However, long-term records demonstrate that N availability is declining in many regions of the world. Reactive N inputs are not evenly distributed, and global changes—including elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels and rising temperatures—are affecting ecosystem N supply relative to demand. Declining N availability is constraining primary productivity, contributing to lower leaf N concentrations, and reducing the quality of herbivore diets in many ecosystems. We outline the current state of knowledge about declining N availability and propose actions aimed at characterizing and responding to this emerging challenge. Nitrogen (N) availability is key to the functioning of ecosystems and the cycling of nutrients and energy through the biosphere. However, there is growing evidence that N availability is decreasing in many terrestrial ecosystems. The consequences of declining N availability will be widespread. For example, a decreased concentration of N in leaves reduces the availability of N to insects, contributing to population declines that may then cascade through higher trophic levels. Mason et al . reviewed the extent of this phenomenon, and the anthropogenic factors that might be driving it (including climate change and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide), and discuss how its damaging effects might be mitigated. —AMS A review explains that a global decline in nitrogen availability is affecting ecosystems, with consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

Effective use of N for biomass production under N limitation may be considered to be a result of a trade-off between the use of N to maintain high levels of specific leaf nitrogen (SLN the amount of N per unit leaf area) for high photosynthetic rate versus using N to maintain leaf area development (leaf area index – LAI). The objective here is to compare the effects of N supply on the dynamics of LAI and SLN for two crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) that contrast in the structure and development of their canopy. Three irrigated experiments imposed different levels of N and plant density. While LAI in both maize and sunflower was reduced under N limitation, leaf area development was more responsive to N supply in sunflower than maize. Observations near anthesis showed that sunflower tended to maintain SLN and adjust leaf area under reduced N supply, whereas maize tended to maintain leaf area and adjust SLN first, and, when this was not sufficient, SLN was also reduced. The two species responded differently to variation in N supply, and the implication of these different strategies for crop adaptation and management is discussed.},

Here we investigate the exchange of carbon for nitrogen in the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis of Fagus sylvatica across different spatial scales from the root system to the cellular level. We provided 15N-labelled nitrogen to mycorrhizal hyphae associated with one half of the root system of young beech trees, while exposing plants to a 13CO2 atmosphere. We analysed the short-term distribution of 13C and 15N in the root system with isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, and at the cellular scale within a mycorrhizal root tip with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). At the root system scale, plants did not allocate more 13C to root parts that received more 15N. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging, however, revealed a highly heterogenous, and spatially significantly correlated distribution of 13C and 15N at the cellular scale. Our results indicate that, on a coarse scale, plants do not allocate a larger proportion of photoassimilated C to root parts associated with N-delivering ectomycorrhizal fungi. Within the ectomycorrhizal tissue, however, recently plant-assimilated C and fungus-delivered N were spatially strongly coupled. Here, NanoSIMS visualisation provides an initial insight into the regulation of ectomycorrhizal C and N exchange at the microscale.},

abstract = {The Penman-Monteith equation (PM) provides a direct and logical route to explaining rates of crop water consumption without the need of resorting to the artificiality of a reference crop and ill-defined crop factors. However as an operational irrigation tool, the PM is often impractical because of uncertainties about stomatal behaviour and turbulent transport. While recent progress is providing better descriptions of these processes, it is questioniable whether such detail is always warranted for practical irrigation. Another option for evaporation prediction is the Priestley and Taylor equation (PT). This approach enjoys reasonable empirical support in humid regions and our efforts here are devoted to better defining its limits of applicability. We begin by presenting previously published and new evidence in support of Priestley and Taylors' value of 1.26 for the coefficient $\alpha$ indicating proportionality between evaporation rate and available energy. While $\alpha$ may depart from this value depending on windspeed and saturation deficit, it is shown to be fairly insensitive to both over a reasonable range of conditions. A daytime mean saturation deficit of 10 gm-3 is suggested as a likely upper limit for the range of applicability of the PT; below this limit, the extra data inputs required for the PM will not be rewarded with a better estimate of evaporation. In arid regions and under stable conditions, fluxes well beyond the PT estimate have been measured and no simple prediction alternative to the PM exists.},

abstract = {The classic model of nitrogen (N) flux into roots is as a Michaelis–Menten (MM) function of soil-N concentration at root surfaces. Furthermore, soil-N transport processes that determine soil-N concentration at root surfaces are seen as a bottleneck for plant nutrition. Yet, neither the MM relationship nor soil-N transport mechanisms are represented in current terrestrial biosphere models. Processes governing N supply to roots – diffusion, mass flow, N immobilization by soil microbes – are incorporated in a model of root-N uptake. We highlight a seldom considered interaction between these processes: nutrient traverses the rhizosphere more quickly in the presence of mass flow, reducing the probability of its immobilization before reaching the root surface. Root-N uptake is sensitive to the rate of mass flow for widely spaced roots with high N uptake capacity, but not for closely spaced roots or roots with low uptake capacity. The results point to a benefit of root switching from high- to low-affinity N transport systems in the presence of mass flow. Simulations indicate a strong impact of soil water uptake on N delivery to widely spaced roots through transpirationally driven mass flow. Furthermore, a given rate of N uptake per unit soil volume may be achieved by lower root biomass in the presence of mass flow.},

abstract = {1. Leaf respiration is a major component of the terrestrial carbon cycle, but is poorly quantified for tropical forests. We measured dark respiration, R, and nutrient concentration (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) of leaves within two forest canopies: in Reserva Jar{\'{u}}, south-west Brazil; and Mbalmayo Reserve, central Cameroon. The data, expressed on a leaf area basis (Ra, Na, Pa) and a leaf mass basis (Rm, Nm, Pm), were used to quantify the temperature sensitivity of R and to test the hypothesis that leaf metabolism is more strongly constrained by phosphorus than by nitrogen in these lowland rainforests. 2. Leaf respiration rate (Ra, at 25 °C) at Jar{\'{u}} was nearly half that at Mbalmayo (the range in Ra from near the ground to the upper canopy was 0{\textperiodcentered}11-0{\textperiodcentered}78 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1 at Jar{\'{u}} versus 0{\textperiodcentered}22-1{\textperiodcentered}19 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1 at Mbalmayo), and the mean Q10 for respiration at each site was 2{\textperiodcentered}3 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}9 (1 SD) and 2{\textperiodcentered}0 ± 0{\textperiodcentered}5 (1 SD), respectively. There were significant differences (P < 0{\textperiodcentered}01) between sites in leaf phosphorus concentration, but not in leaf nitrogen concentration: Pm was very low at Jar{\'{u}} (0{\textperiodcentered}2-0{\textperiodcentered}7 mg g1-) but higher at Mbalmayo (0{\textperiodcentered}5-2{\textperiodcentered}4 mg g-1), whilst Nm was similar at both forests (10-45 mg g-1). 3. Rm was not significantly associated with canopy position or specific leaf area (SLA, m2 g-1) in either forest, but a significant relationship between SLA and Nm was found for both sites (P < 0{\textperiodcentered}05), consistent with existing data. At Jar{\'{u}}, Rm was strongly related to Pm (P < 0{\textperiodcentered}001) and less strongly related to Nm (P < 0{\textperiodcentered}05), but at Mbalmayo, Rm was not significantly related to either Pm or Nm. 4. Ra was linearly related to Na and Pa at both sites (P < 0{\textperiodcentered}01), principally because of changes in leaf mass per area (LMA, g m-2) associated with canopy position. At Mbalmayo, LMA explained 70% of the variation in Ra, but only 20% at Jar{\'{u}}. For Jar{\'{u}}, the strongest relationship with Ra was obtained by combining LMA with Pm in a multiple regression (r2 = 0{\textperiodcentered}53); further inclusion of Nm did not improve the regression. At Mbalmayo neither Nm or Pm improved the regression of Ra on LMA. 5. These results indicate a strong influence of LMA on the relative rates of Ra within the vertical gradient of each canopy. They also suggest that at Jar{\'{u}} Pm constrains respiration more strongly than Nm, and further, that the very low Pm at Jar{\'{u}} may explain the lower absolute values of respiration there relative to Mbalmayo, where Pm was higher. The leaves at both sites are typical of lowland tropical rainforests in not having particularly low Nm, and consistent with this, Nm was a weaker predictor of respiration than Pm or LMA.},

abstract = {The observation of acclimation in leaf photosynthetic capacity to differences in growth irradiance has been widely used as support for a hypothesis that enables a simplification of some soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) photosynthesis models. The acclimation hypothesis requires that relative leaf nitrogen concentration declines with relative irradiance from the top of a canopy to the bottom, in 1: 1 proportion. In combination with a light transmission model it enables a simple estimate of the vertical profile in leaf nitrogen concentration (which is assumed to determine maximum carboxylation capacity), and in combination with estimates of the fraction of absorbed radiation it also leads to simple 'big-leaf' analytical solutions for canopy photosynthesis. We tested how forests deviate from this condition in five tree canopies, including four broadleaf stands, and one needle-leaf stand: a mixed-species tropical rain forest, oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl), birch (Betula pendula Roth), beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr). Each canopy was studied when fully developed (mid-to-late summer for temperate stands). Irradiance (Q,$\mu$mol m-2 s-1) was measured for 20 d using quantum sensors placed throughout the vertical canopy profile. Measurements were made to obtain parameters from leaves adjacent to the radiation sensors: maximum carboxylation and electron transfer capacity (Va, Ja,$\mu$mol m-2 s-1), day respiration (Rda, $\mu$mol m-2s-1leaf nitrogen concentration (Nm, mg g-1) and leaf mass per unit area (La, g m-2). Relative to upper-canopy values, Va declined linearly in 1: 1 proportion with Na. Relative Va also declined linearly with relative Q, but with a significant intercept at zero irradiance (P < 0.01). This intercept was strongly related to La of the lowest leaves in each canopy (P < 0.01, r2= 0.98, n = 5). For each canopy, daily InQ was also linearly related with In Va (P < 0.05), and the intercept was correlated with the value for photosynthetic capacity per unit nitrogen (PUN: Va/Na,$\mu$mol g-1s-1) of the lowest leaves in each canopy (P < 0.05). Va was linearly related with La and Na (P < 0.01), but the slope of the Va: Na relationship varied widely among sites. Hence, whilst there was a unique Va: Na ratio in each stand, acclimation in Va to Q varied predictably with La of the lowest leaves in each canopy. The specific leaf area, Lm (cm2 g-1), of the canopy-bottom foliage was also found to predict carboxylation capacity (expressed on a mass basis; Vm,$\mu$mol g-1 s-1 at all sites (P < 0.01). These results invalidate the hypothesis of full acclimation to irradiance, but suggest that La and Lm of the most light-limited leaves in a canopy are widely applicable indicators of the distribution of photosynthetic capacity with height in forests.},

abstract = {Nutrient limitation to net primary production (NPP) displays a diversity of patterns as ecosystems develop over a range of timescales. For example, some ecosystems transition from N limitation on young soils to P limitation on geologically old soils, whereas others appear to remain N limited. Under what conditions should N limitation and P limitation prevail? When do transitions between N and P limitation occur? We analyzed transient dynamics of multiple timescales in an ecosystem model to investigate these questions. Post-disturbance dynamics in our model are controlled by a cascade of rates, from plant uptake (very fast) to litter turnover (fast) to plant mortality (intermediate) to plant-unavailable nutrient loss (slow) to weathering (very slow). Young ecosystems are N limited when symbiotic N fixation (SNF) is constrained and P weathering inputs are high relative to atmospheric N deposition and plant N:P demand, but P limited under opposite conditions. In the absence of SNF, N limitation is likely to worsen through succession (decades to centuries) because P is mineralized faster than N. Over long timescales (centuries and longer) this preferential P mineralization increases the N:P ratio of soil organic matter, leading to greater losses of plant-unavailable N versus P relative to plant N:P demand. These loss dynamics favor N limitation on older soils despite the rising organic matter N:P ratio. However, weathering depletion favors P limitation on older soils when continual P inputs (e.g., dust deposition) are low, so nutrient limitation at the terminal equilibrium depends on the balance of these input and loss effects. If NPP switches from N to P limitation over long time periods, the transition time depends most strongly on the P weathering rate. At all timescales SNF has the capacity to overcome N limitation, so nutrient limitation depends critically on limits to SNF.},

abstract = {Symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixing trees are absent from old-growth temperate and boreal ecosystems, even though many of these are N-limited. To explore mechanisms that could select against N fixation in N-limited, old-growth ecosystems, we developed a simple resource-based evolutionary model of N fixation. When there are no costs of N fixation, increasing amounts of N fixation will be selected for until N no longer limits production. However, tradeoffs between N fixation and plant mortality or turnover, plant uptake of available soil N, or N use efficiency (NUE) can select against N fixation in N-limited ecosystems and can thereby maintain N limitation indefinitely (provided that there are losses of plant-unavailable N). Three key traits influence the threshold that determines how large these tradeoffs must be to select against N fixation. A low NUE, high mortality (or turnover) rate and low losses of plant-unavailable N all increase the likelihood that N fixation will be selected against, and a preliminary examination of published data on these parameters shows that these mechanisms, particularly the tradeoff with NUE, are quite feasible in some systems. Although these results are promising, a better characterization of these parameters in multiple ecosystems is necessary to determine whether these mechanisms explain the lack of symbiotic N fixers—and thus the maintenance of N limitation—in old-growth forests.},

abstract = {Symbiotic N 2 fixation (SNF) brings nitrogen into ecosystems, fuelling much of the world's agriculture 1 and sustaining carbon storage 2,3 . However, it can also cause nitrogen satur-ation, exacerbating eutrophication and greenhouse warming 4– 7 . The balance of these effects depends on the degree to which N 2 -fixing plants adjust how much N 2 they fix based on their needs (their SNF 'strategies') 5,6 . Genetic, biochemical and physiological details of SNF are well known for certain economically important species 8,9 , but the diversity of N 2 -fixing plants 10 and bacteria 11 is enormous, and little is known about most N 2 -fixing symbioses in natural ecosystems 12 . Here, we show that co-occurring, closely related herbs exhibit diverse SNF strategies. In response to a nitrogen supply gradi-ent, four species fixed less N 2 than they needed (over-regulation), two fixed what they needed (facultative) and two did not downregulate SNF (obligate). No species downregu-lated but fixed more N 2 than it needed (under-regulation or incomplete downregulation), but some species under-regulated or incompletely downregulated structural allocation to SNF. In fact, most species maintained nodules (the root structures that house symbionts) when they did not fix N 2 , suggesting decoupling of SNF activity and structure. Simulations showed that over-regulation of SNF activity is more adaptive than under-regulation or incomplete downregulation, and that different strategies have wildly different effects on ecosys-tem-level nitrogen cycling. Decades of research reveal that high levels of inorganic nitrogen inhibit SNF in some N 2 -fixing plants (hereafter, 'N 2 fixers') 3,8,13,14 , which makes sense for the plant for two reasons. First, SNF is more biochemically costly than using soil inorganic nitrogen 15 . Second, the overall cost of SNF to the plant can greatly exceed the biochemical cost because symbiotic bacteria vary in their effi-ciency 16 . However, some studies show that soil inorganic nitrogen seems to have no effect on or even to stimulate SNF 4,17 , calling into question the ubiquity of nitrogen inhibition to SNF. Inspired by these contrasting results, two distinct ways that SNF responds to plant nutrition ('strategies') have been proposed 5,6,18 . 'Facultative' N 2 fixers fix just enough N 2 to meet their nitrogen demand after using whatever soil nitrogen they can, whereas 'obligate' N 2 fixers do not change SNF per plant biomass regardless of soil nitrogen availability. Obligate SNF can be evolutionarily stable if adjusting SNF is costly, and confers advantages over non-fixers where soil nitrogen scarcity is common, but leads to build up and loss of soil inorganic nitrogen (nitrogen saturation). By con-trast, facultative SNF is evolutionarily stable if the fitness cost of adjusting SNF is low. Because a facultative strategy does not directly enhance inorganic nitrogen availability to neighbouring non-fixers, it confers a competitive advantage over non-fixers when nitrogen is at least marginally limiting 5,6,18 . Although it is clear that facultative and obligate SNF would have contrasting effects on plant fitness, competition and ecosystem pro-cesses, the distribution of SNF strategies in nature is unknown. At present, no experimental method exists to determine conclusively which plants are facultative, which are obligate and, critically, which employ some other strategy. For example, studies that show nitrogen inhibition of SNF are consistent with a strictly facultative SNF strategy, where plants fix precisely as much N 2 as they need. However, these studies are also consistent with other SNF strategies, where plants downregulate SNF but fix more or less N 2 than they need. Here, we develop a novel, theory-based experimental method to detect facultative SNF, obligate SNF or divergence from these strategies. We then experimentally determine SNF strategies for eight co-occurring herbs from a Mediterranean ecosystem. Finally, we evaluate how divergence from facultative or obligate SNF strategies affects ecosystems by extending a previous theoretical model. Facultative and obligate SNF strategies can be predicted if we know the extent of nitrogen limitation that plants would experience with and without access to their N 2 -fixing symbionts. To detect limitation regimes, we grew eight legume species in a greenhouse across a realistic range of soil nitrogen supply, inoculating half of the individuals per species with symbiotic bacteria. For each species, we estimated nitrogen demand for inoculated and uninocu-lated treatments by how biomass nitrogen changed with nitrogen addition (Fig. 1, Methods and Supplementary Methods). We used biomass nitrogen instead of biomass because luxury consumption has adaptive benefits 19,20 , but we discuss the implications of this assumption below. To do this, we first fit theoretical functions to biomass nitrogen data. We used these fits to generate quantitative predictions for nodule density (mg nodule per g plant), which indi-cates structural investment in SNF, and the percentage of nitrogen derived from fixation activity (%N dfa), which quantifies SNF activity, under obligate and facultative scenarios. Obligate and facultative strategies have theoretical underpin-nings, but likely represent just two points along a gradient of regu-lation. To fill in this gradient, we define three additional strategies. Two of these strategies are defined by the average slope of SNF downregulation as nitrogen supply increases (Fig. 1b,c). Over-regulation indicates less SNF than required to balance demand, so it has a steeper slope than facultative SNF. By contrast, under-regulation has a slope between facultative and obligate strategies. A third strategy, incomplete downregulation, indicates some down-regulation, but sustained SNF (at a lower level than obligate SNF) when soil nitrogen supply exceeds demand. It divides obligate and facultative strategies along a separate axis: the rate of SNF at which soil nitrogen supply is sufficient. Because each of these three strategies involves downregulation of SNF, previous studies could not distinguish between them and facultative SNF.},

abstract = {Vegetation regulates land-atmosphere, water, and energy exchanges and is an essential component of land-surface models (LSMs). However, LSMs have been handicapped by assumptions that equate acclimated photosynthetic responses to the environment with the fast responses observable in the laboratory. The effects of acclimation can be taken into account by including PFT-specific values of photosynthetic parameters, but at the cost of increasing parameter requirements. Here, we develop an alternative approach for including acclimation in LSMs by adopting the P model, an existing light-use efficiency model for gross primary production (GPP) that implicitly predicts the acclimation of photosynthetic parameters on a weekly to monthly timescale via optimality principles. We demonstrate that it is possible to explicitly separate the fast and slow photosynthetic responses to environmental conditions, allowing the simulation of GPP at the sub-daily timesteps required for coupling in an LSM. The resulting model reproduces the diurnal cycles of GPP recorded by eddy-covariance flux towers in a temperate grassland and boreal, temperate and tropical forests. The best performance is achieved when biochemical capacities are adjusted to match recent midday conditions. Comparison between this model and the operational LSM in the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts climate model shows that the new model has better predictive power in most of the sites and years analyzed, particularly in summer and autumn. Our analyses suggest a simple and parameter-sparse method to include both instantaneous and acclimated responses within an LSM framework, with potential applications in weather, climate, and carbon-cycle modeling.},

The dataset contains records from over 80 000 stations in 180 countries and territories, and its processing system produces the official archive for U.S. daily data. Variables commonly include maximum and minimum temperature, total daily precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth; however, about two-thirds of the stations report precipitation only. Quality assurance checks are routinely applied to the full dataset, but the data are not homogenized to account for artifacts associated with the various eras in reporting practice at any particular station (i.e., for changes in systematic bias). Daily updates are provided for many of the station records in GHCN-Daily. The dataset is also regularly reconstructed, usually once per week, from its 201 data source components, ensuring that the dataset is broadly synchronized with its growing list of constituent sources. The daily updates and weekly reprocessed versions of GHCN-Daily are assigned a unique version number, and the most recent dataset version is provided on the GHCN-Daily website for free public access.

Version 4 (v4) fulfills the goal of aligning GHCNmtemperature values with the GHCNdaily dataset and makes use of data from previous versions of GHCNm as well as data collated under the auspices of the International Surface Temperature Initiative. GHCNm v4 has many thousands of additional stations compared to version 3 (v3) both historically and with short time-delay updates. The greater number of stations as well as the use of records with incomplete data during the base period provides for greater global coverage throughout the record compared to earlier versions. Like v3, the monthly averages are screened for random errors and homogenized to address systematic errors. New to v4, uncertainties are calculated for each station series, and regional uncertainties scale directly from the station uncertainties. Correlated errors in the station series are quantified by running the homogenization algorithm as an ensemble. Additional uncertainties associated with incomplete homogenization and use of anomalies are then incorporated into the station ensemble. Further uncertainties are quantified at the regional level, the most important of which is for incomplete spatial coverage. Overall, homogenization has a smaller impact on the v4 global trend compared to v3, though adjustments lead to much greater consistency than between the unadjusted versions. The adjusted v3 global mean therefore falls within the range of uncertainty for v4 adjusted data. Likewise, annual anomaly uncertainties for the other major independent land surface air temperature datasets overlap with GHCNm v4 uncertainties.},

abstract = {Plant temperature responses vary geographically, reflecting thermally contrasting habitats and long-term species adaptations to their climate of origin. Plants also can acclimate to fast temporal changes in temperature regime to mitigate stress. Although plant photosynthetic responses are known to acclimate to temperature, many global models used to predict future vegetation and climate–carbon interactions do not include this process. We quantify the global and regional impacts of biogeographical variability and thermal acclimation of temperature response of photosynthetic capacity on the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle between 1860 and 2100 within a coupled climate–carbon cycle model, that emulates 22 global climate models. Results indicate that inclusion of biogeographical variation in photosynthetic temperature response is most important for present-day and future C uptake, with increasing importance of thermal acclimation under future warming. Accounting for both effects narrows the range of predictions of the simulated global land C storage in 2100 across climate projections (29% and 43% globally and in the tropics, respectively). Contrary to earlier studies, our results suggest that thermal acclimation of photosynthetic capacity makes tropical and temperate C less vulnerable to warming, but reduces the warming-induced C uptake in the boreal region under elevated CO2.},

abstract = {The magnitude of the nitrogen (N) limitation of terrestrial carbon (C) storage over the 21st century is highly uncertain because of the complex interactions between the terrestrial C and N cycles. We use an ensemble approach to quantify and attribute process-level uncertainty in C-cycle projections by analysing a 30-member ensemble representing published alternative representations of key N cycle processes (stoichiometry, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and ecosystem N losses) within the framework of one terrestrial biosphere model. Despite large differences in the simulated present-day N cycle, primarily affecting simulated productivity north of 40°N, ensemble members generally conform with global C-cycle benchmarks for present-day conditions. Ensemble projections for two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) show that the increase in land C storage due to CO2 fertilization is reduced by 24 ± 15% due to N constraints, whereas terrestrial C losses associated with climate change are attenuated by 19 ± 20%. As a result, N cycling reduces projected land C uptake for the years 2006–2099 by 19% (37% decrease to 3% increase) for RCP 2.6, and by 21% (40% decrease to 9% increase) for RCP 8.5. Most of the ensemble spread results from uncertainty in temperate and boreal forests, and is dominated by uncertainty in BNF (10% decrease to 50% increase for RCP 2.6, 5% decrease to 100% increase for RCP 8.5). However, choices about the flexibility of ecosystem C:N ratios and processes controlling ecosystem N losses regionally also play important roles. The findings of this study demonstrate clearly the need for an ensemble approach to quantify likely future terrestrial C–N cycle trajectories. Present-day C-cycle observations only weakly constrain the future ensemble spread, highlighting the need for better observational constraints on large-scale N cycling, and N cycle process responses to global change.},

abstract = {Abstract. Including a terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycle in Earth system models has led to substantial attenuation of predicted biosphere–climate feedbacks. However, the magnitude of this attenuation remains uncertain. A particularly important but highly uncertain process is biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which is the largest natural input of N to land ecosystems globally. In order to quantify this uncertainty and estimate likely effects on terrestrial biosphere dynamics, we applied six alternative formulations of BNF spanning the range of process formulations in current state-of-the-art biosphere models within a common framework, the O-CN model: a global map of static BNF rates, two empirical relationships between BNF and other ecosystem variables (net primary productivity and evapotranspiration), two process-oriented formulations based on plant N status, and an optimality-based approach. We examined the resulting differences in model predictions under ambient and elevated atmospheric [CO2] and found that the predicted global BNF rates and their spatial distribution for contemporary conditions were broadly comparable, ranging from 108 to 148 Tg N yr−1 (median: 128 Tg N yr−1), despite distinct regional patterns associated with the assumptions of each approach. Notwithstanding, model responses in BNF rates to elevated levels of atmospheric [CO2] (+200 ppm) ranged between −4 Tg N yr−1 (−3 %) and 56 Tg N yr−1 (+42 %) (median: 7 Tg N yr−1 (+8 %)). As a consequence, future projections of global ecosystem carbon (C) storage (+281 to +353 Pg C, or +13 to +16 %) as well as N2O emission (−1.6 to +0.5 Tg N yr−1, or −19 to +7 %) differed significantly across the different model formulations. Our results emphasize the importance of better understanding the nature and magnitude of BNF responses to change-induced perturbations, particularly through new empirical perturbation experiments and improved model representation.},

abstract = {Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are low molecular weight, open-chained, organic polycations which are found in all organisms and have been linked with stress responses in plants. The objectives of our study were to investigate the effects of chronic N additions to pine and hardwood stands at Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA on foliar polyamine and inorganic ion contents as well as soil and soil solution chemistry. Four treatment plots were established within each stand in 1988: control, low N (50 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as NH4NO3), low N + sulfur (74 kg S ha-1 yr-1 as Na2SO4), and high N (150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as NH4NO3). All samples were analyzed for inorganic elements; foliage samples were also analyzed for polyamines and total N. In the pine stand putrescine and total N levels in the foliage were significantly higher for all N treatments as compared to the control plot. Total N content was positively correlated with polyamines in the needles (P ≤ 0.05). Both putrescine and N contents were also negatively correlated with most exchangeable cations and total elements in organic soil horizons and positively correlated with Ca and Mg in the soil solution (P ≤ 0.05). In the hardwood stand, putrescine and total N levels in the foliage were significantly higher for the high N treatment only as compared to the control plot. Here also, total foliar N content was positively correlated with polyamines (P ≤ 0.05). Unlike the case with the pine stand, in the hardwood stand foliar polyamines and N were significantly and negatively correlated with foliar total Ca, Mg, and Mn (P ≤ 0.05). Additional significant (P ≤ 0.05) relationships in hardwoods included: negative correlations between foliar polyamines and N content to exchangeable K and P and total P in the organic soil horizon; and positive correlations between foliar polyamines and N content to Mg in soil solution. With few exceptions, low N + S treatment had effects similar to the ones observed with low N alone for both stands. The changes observed in the pine stand for polyamine metabolism, N uptake, and element leaching from the soil into the soil solution in all treatment plots provide additional evidence that the pine stand is more nitrogen saturated than the hardwood stand. These results also indicate that the long-term addition of N to these stands has species specific and/or site specific effects that may in part be explained by the different land use histories of the two stands.},

abstract = {Mineral nutrients play a pivotal role in plant growth, development and reproduction. The uptake and distribution of nutrients are generally limited by soil nutrient availability, affected by global change. However, the responses of foliar mineral nutrient concentrations to changes in soil nutrient availability remain largely untested in tropical forests. We used a field-based experiment with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition in a tropical forest in southern China to investigate the effect of N and P fertilization on exchangeable soil and foliar mineral nutrients of five understorey species. Our results show that N addition did not change soil pH, but reduced exchangeable soil Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+ concentrations. In contrast, P addition increased soil pH, while it had no effects on exchangeable cations. Nitrogen addition significantly decreased foliar [Ca], [Mg] and [Mn], while P addition markedly reduced foliar [Cu] for most of the studied species. Foliar [K] and [Fe] were not affected by fertilization. The results indicate that long-term N addition reduced the concentrations of several mineral nutrients in leaves, and we did not observe any adaptive mechanisms (e.g. increased transpiration to take up mobile soil nutrients) in the studied species to maintain foliar nutrient concentrations at high N supply. Synthesis. The responses of other foliar nutrient concentrations to N and P co-addition were more complicated than those of N and/or P, and the specific decreases in mineral nutrient concentrations following long-term N addition may influence key physiological process in the studied tropical understorey species, and ultimately reduce their fitness and survival under high N deposition.

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 enrichment may stimulate plant growth directly through (1) enhanced photosynthesis or indirectly, through (2) reduced plant water consumption and hence slower soil moisture depletion, or the combination of both. Herein we describe gas exchange, plant biomass and species responses of five native or semi-native temperate and Mediterranean grasslands and three semi-arid systems to CO2 enrichment, with an emphasis on water relations. Increasing CO2 led to decreased leaf conductance for water vapor, improved plant water status, altered seasonal evapotranspiration dynamics, and in most cases, periodic increases in soil water content. The extent, timing and duration of these responses varied among ecosystems, species and years. Across the grasslands of the Kansas tallgrass prairie, Colorado shortgrass steppe and Swiss calcareous grassland, increases in aboveground biomass from CO2 enrichment were relatively greater in dry years. In contrast, CO2-induced aboveground biomass increases in the Texas C3/C4 grassland and the New Zealand pasture seemed little or only marginally influenced by yearly variation in soil water, while plant growth in the Mojave Desert was stimulated by CO2 in a relatively wet year. Mediterranean grasslands sometimes failed to respond to CO 2-related increased late-season water, whereas semiarid Negev grassland assemblages profited. Vegetative and reproductive responses to CO 2 were highly varied among species and ecosystems, and did not generally follow any predictable pattern in regard to functional groups. Results suggest that the indirect effects of CO2 on plant and soil water relations may contribute substantially to experimentally induced CO 2-effects, and also reflect local humidity conditions. For landscape scale predictions, this analysis calls for a clear distinction between biomass responses due to direct CO2 effects on photosynthesis and those indirect CO2 effects via soil moisture as documented here. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in soybeans is a complex process involving the interplay between the plant host and the symbiotic rhizobia. As nitrogen supply has a crucial role in growth and development, higher nitrogen fixation capacity would be important to achieve bigger plants and larger seeds, which were important selection criteria during plant domestication by humans. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the nitrogen fixation-related performance in 31 cultivated and 17 wild soybeans after inoculation with the slow-growing Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens sp. nov. USDA110 and the fast-growing Sinorhizobium (Ensifer) fredii CCBAU45436. Our results showed that, in general, cultivated soybeans gave better performance in BNF. Electron microscopic studies indicated that there was an exceptionally high accumulation of poly-$\beta$-hydroxybutyrate bodies in bacteroids in the nodules of all wild soybeans tested, suggesting that the C/N balance in wild soybeans may not be optimized for nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, we identified new quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for total ureides and total nodule fresh weight by employing a recombinant inbred population composed of descendants from a cross between a cultivated and a wild parent. Using nucleotide diversity ($\theta$$\pi$), divergence index (F st) and distribution of fixed single-nucleotide polymorphisms as parameters, we found that some regions in the total ureides QTL on chromosome 17 and the total nodule fresh weight QTL on chromosome 12 exhibited very low diversity among cultivated soybeans, suggesting that these were traits specially selected during the domestication and breeding process.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll fluorescence is a non-invasive measurement of photosystem II (PSII) activity and is a commonly used technique in plant physiology. The sensitivity of PSII activity to abiotic and biotic factors has made this a key technique not only for understanding the photosynthetic mechanisms but also as a broader indicator of how plants respond to environmental change. This, along with low cost and ease of collecting data, has resulted in the appearance of a large array of instrument types for measurement and calculated parameters which can be bewildering for the new user. Moreover, its accessibility can lead to misuse and misinterpretation when the underlying photosynthetic processes are not fully appreciated. This review is timely because it sits at a point of renewed interest in chlorophyll fluorescence where fast measurements of photosynthetic performance are now required for crop improvement purposes. Here we help the researcher make choices in terms of protocols using the equipment and expertise available, especially for field measurements. We start with a basic overview of the principles of fluorescence analysis and provide advice on best practice for taking pulse amplitude-modulated measurements. We also discuss a number of emerging techniques for contemporary crop and ecology research, where we see continual development and application of analytical techniques to meet the new challenges that have arisen in recent years. We end the review by briefly discussing the emerging area of monitoring fluorescence, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, field phenotyping, and remote sensing of crops for yield and biomass enhancement. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.},

abstract = {Garlic ( Allium sativum ) is a commercially and culturally important crop worldwide. Despite the importance of garlic, there have been few studies investigating how garlic growth and development will be affected by the atmospheric enrichment of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). A split-plot experiment with CO 2 concentrations as main plot and nitrogen (N) fertilization as subplot was carried out to examine the effects of elevated CO 2 at (mean ± sd ) 745 ± 63 µmol{\textperiodcentered}mol −1 across three levels of N: high-N (16.0 m m ), mid-N (4.0 m m ), and low-N (1.0 m m ). Three hypotheses were tested: 1) garlic plants will allocate proportionally more biomass to bulb when grown in elevated CO 2 compared with the plants grown in ambient CO 2 ; 2) plants will sustain improved photosynthesis without downregulation in elevated CO 2 , irrespective of N; and 3) elevated CO 2 will improve plant water use efficiency (WUE) across N fertilization levels. We found that proportional biomass allocation to bulb was not significantly enhanced by CO 2 enrichment in garlic. Overall biomass accumulation represented by leaf, stem, and bulb did not respond significantly to CO 2 enrichment but responded strongly to N treatments ( P < 0.001). Contrary to our hypothesis, photosynthetic downregulation was apparent for garlic plants grown in elevated CO 2 with a decrease in Rubisco capacity ( P < 0.01). Instantaneous leaf WUE improved in response to elevated CO 2 ( P < 0.001) and also with increasing N fertilization ( P < 0.001). Finally, our results indicate that bulbing ratio is likely to remain unchanged with CO 2 or N levels and may continue to serve as a useful nondesctructive metric to estimate harvest timing and bulb size.},

abstract = {Net primary productivity (NPP) in northern temperate forests is an important part of the global carbon cycle. Because NPP often is limited by nitrogen (N), atmospheric N deposition (Ndep) may increase forest NPP. At a northern hardwood forest site in northern Lower Michigan, USA, we quantified rates of N supply by Ndep, canopy retention of Ndep (Ncr), and soil net N mineralization (Nmin); calculated the N requirement of NPP; and estimated the fraction of NPP that could be attributed to atmospheric N inputs. Net N mineralization supplied 42.6 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha–1{\textperiodcentered}year–1 (84% of the NPP N requirement), and Ndep averaged 7.5 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha–1{\textperiodcentered}year–1 (15%). The forest canopy retained 38% of Ndep (Ncr = 2.8 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha–1{\textperiodcentered}year–1), primarily in the forms of organic N and NH4-N. Fine root (62%) and leaf (31%) N requirements dominated the NPP N requirement of 50.7 kg N{\textperiodcentered}ha–1{\textperiodcentered}year–1. Annual N supply by the processes we measured agreed very closely with the NPP N requirement, suggesting that internally cycled N and N of atmospheric origin ...},

abstract = {Soil moisture supply and atmospheric demand for water independently limit - and profoundly affect - vegetation productivity and water use during periods of hydrologic stress. Disentangling the impact of these two drivers on ecosystem carbon and water cycling is difficult because they are often correlated, and experimental tools for manipulating atmospheric demand in the field are lacking. Consequently, the role of atmospheric demand is often not adequately factored into experiments or represented in models. Here we show that atmospheric demand limits surface conductance and evapotranspiration to a greater extent than soil moisture in many biomes, including mesic forests that are of particular importance to the terrestrial carbon sink. Further, using projections from ten general circulation models, we show that climate change will increase the importance of atmospheric constraints to carbon and water fluxes in all ecosystems. Consequently, atmospheric demand will become increasingly important for vegetation function, accounting for >70% of growing season limitation to surface conductance in mesic temperate forests. Our results suggest that failure to consider the limiting role of atmospheric demand in experimental designs, simulation models and land management strategies will lead to incorrect projections of ecosystem responses to future climate conditions.},

Stable (13)C-labelling was used to trace assimilated CO(2) to the mycorrhizal fungus in roots and soil using compound-specific isotope ratio mass spectrometry. We used the neutral lipid fatty acid 16:1omega5 as a signature for AM fungal storage lipids. Both P and shading reduced the AM fungal lipid accumulation in the intraradical mycelium, while only P reduced the amount of lipids in the extraradical mycelium. Recently assimilated plant C was only allocated to the mycorrhizal fungus to a small extent when plant mycorrhizal benefit was reduced by P fertilization, while increasing the plant C cost by shading did not reduce the C flow to the fungus. These results are of importance for our conception of mycorrhizal dynamics during periods of shade in nature.},

abstract = {Responses of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to increasing vapour pressure deficit (D) generally follow an exponential decrease described equally well by several empirical functions. However, the magnitude of the decrease - the stomatal sensitivity - varies considerably both within and between species. Here we analysed data from a variety of sources employing both porometric and sap flux estimates of g(s) to evaluate the hypothesis that stomatal sensitivity is proportional to the magnitude of g(s) at low D (≤ 1 kPa). To test this relationship we used the function g(s) = g(sref) - m {\textperiodcentered} lnD where m is the stomatal sensitivity and g(sref) = g(s) at D = 1 kPa. Regardless of species or methodology, m was highly correlated with g(sref) (average r2 = 0.75) with a slope of approximately 0.6. We demonstrate that this empirical slope is consistent with the theoretical slope derived from a simple hydraulic model that assumes stomatal regulation of leaf water potential. The theoretical slope is robust to deviations from underlying assumptions and variation in model parameters. The relationships within and among species are close to theoretical predictions, regardless of whether the analysis is based on porometric measurements of g(s) in relation to leaf-surface D (D(s)), or on sap flux-based stomatal conductance of whole trees (G(Si)), or stand-level stomatal conductance (G(S)) in relation to D. Thus, individuals, species, and stands with high stomatal conductance at low D show a greater sensitivity to D, as required by the role of stomata in regulating leaf water potential.},

abstract = {Grasses using the C4 photosynthetic pathway dominate grasslands and savannahs of warm regions, and account for half of the species in this ecologically and economically important plant family. The C4 pathway increases the potential for high rates of photosynthesis, particularly at high irradiance, and raises water-use efficiency compared with the C3 type. It is therefore classically viewed as an adaptation to open, arid conditions. Here, we test this adaptive hypothesis using the comparative method, analysing habitat data for 117 genera of grasses, representing 15 C4 lineages. The evidence from our three complementary analyses is consistent with the hypothesis that evolutionary selection for C4 photosynthesis requires open environments, but we find an equal likelihood of C4 evolutionary origins in mesic, arid and saline habitats. However, once the pathway has arisen, evolutionary transitions into arid habitats occur at higher rates in C4 than C3 clades. Extant C4 genera therefore occupy a wider range of drier habitats than their C3 counterparts because the C4 pathway represents a pre-adaptation to arid conditions. Our analyses warn against evolutionary inferences based solely upon the high occurrence of extant C4 species in dry habitats, and provide a novel interpretation of this classic ecological association. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Understanding variation in leaf functional traits—including rates of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus—is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology. When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically increase with leaf mass per area (LMA) within species but are roughly independent of LMA across the global flora. LMA is determined by mass components with different biological functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (LL). A possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is that most LMA variation within species is associated with variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most LMA variation across the global flora is associated with variation in structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that (i) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf area should increase strongly with LMA across species assemblages with low LL variance but should increase weakly with LMA across species assemblages with high LL variance and that (ii) controlling for LL variation should increase the strength of the above LMA relationships. We present analyses of intra- and interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait relationships exhibited by different leaf assemblages can be understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and structural mass components contribute to LMA variation in a given assemblage.},

The effects of soil water and nutrient availability on photosynthesis should be stronger as climate-related costs for both resources increase.  Two independent datasets of photosynthetic traits, Globamax (1509 species, 288 sites) and Glob13C (3645 species, 594 sites), were used to quantify biophysical and biochemical limita- tions of photosynthesis and the key variable Ci /Ca (CO 2 drawdown during photosynthesis). Climate and soil variables were associated with both datasets.  The biochemical photosynthetic capacity was higher on alkaline soils. This effect was strongest at more arid sites, where water unit-costs are presumably higher. Higher values of soil silt and depth increased Ci /Ca, likely by providing greater H 2O supply, alleviating biophys- ical photosynthetic limitation when soil water is scarce.  Climate is important in controlling the optimal balance of H 2 O and N costs for photosynthe- sis, but soil properties change these costs, both directly and indirectly.

abstract = {Uncertainty about long-term leaf-level responses to atmospheric CO2 rise is a major knowledge gap that exists because of limited empirical data. Thus, it remains unclear how responses of leaf gas exchange to elevated CO2 (eCO2) vary among plant species and functional groups, or across different levels of nutrient supply, and whether they persist over time for long-lived perennials. Here, we report the effects of eCO2 on rates of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in 14 perennial grassland species from four functional groups over two decades in a Minnesota Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiment, BioCON. Monocultures of species belonging to C3 grasses, C4 grasses, forbs, and legumes were exposed to two levels of CO2 and nitrogen supply in factorial combinations over 21 years. eCO2 increased photosynthesis by 12.9% on average in C3 species, substantially less than model predictions of instantaneous responses based on physiological theory and results of other studies, even those spanning multiple years. Acclimation of photosynthesis to eCO2 was observed beginning in the first year and did not strengthen through time. Yet, contrary to expectations, the response of photosynthesis to eCO2 was not enhanced by increased nitrogen supply. Differences in responses among herbaceous plant functional groups were modest, with legumes responding the most and C4 grasses the least as expected, but did not further diverge over time. Leaf-level water-use efficiency increased by 50% under eCO2 primarily because of reduced stomatal conductance. Our results imply that enhanced nitrogen supply will not necessarily diminish photosynthetic acclimation to eCO2 in nitrogen-limited systems, and that significant and consistent declines in stomatal conductance and increases in water-use efficiency under eCO2 may allow plants to better withstand drought.},

abstract = {Simulation models of net mineralization of nitrogen (N) in soil need to be able to incorporate the effect of soil water. Our objective was to identify and define the best way of expressing soil water and its effect on net mineralization across a range of soil types. We collated data from 12 laboratory incubation studies, including a total of 33 different soils, where rates of net mineralization of N were determined from the net accumulation of mineral N under a range of water contents at near-optimal temperatures. Measurements of water potential and limits of water content observed in the field were available for most of these soils. The percentage of pore space filled with water was estimated from measurements of soil bulk density. We found that relative water content, particularly when expressed relative to an upper and lower limit of water content observed in the field, was the best descriptor for net mineralization. The next best descriptions were soil water potential, water content relative to the optimal water content for mineralization, and percentage of pore space filled with water, with water content alone being poor. Although various functions may be used to describe the relation between relative water content and net mineralization of N, an equation for a sigmoidal curve provided the best fit, and explained 78% of the variation.},

Investigating the distribution of gene traits associated with SOM decay among ectomycorrhizal fungal communities could improve understanding of SOM dynamics and plant nutrition. We hypothesized that soil inorganic nitrogen (N) availability structures the distribution of ECM fungal genes associated with SOM decay and, specifically, that ECM fungal communities occurring in inorganic N-poor soils have greater SOM decay potential. To test this hypothesis, we paired amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 60 ECM fungal communities associating with Quercus rubra along a natural soil inorganic N gradient. Ectomycorrhizal fungal communities occurring in low inorganic N soils were enriched in gene families involved in the decay of lignin, cellulose, and chitin. Ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition was the strongest driver of shifts in metagenomic estimates of fungal decay potential. Our study simultaneously illuminates the identity of key ECM fungal taxa and gene families potentially involved in the decay of SOM, and we link rhizomorphic and medium-distance hyphal morphologies with enhanced SOM decay potential. Coupled shifts in ECM fungal community composition and community-level decay gene frequencies are consistent with outcomes of trait-mediated community assembly processes.},

abstract = {There is huge uncertainty about how global exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere and land will respond to continuing environmental change. A better representation of photosynthetic capacity is required for Earth System models to simulate carbon assimilation reliably. Here we use a global leaf-trait dataset to test whether photosynthetic capacity is quantitatively predictable from climate, based on optimality principles; and to explore how this prediction is modified by soil properties, including indices of nitrogen and phosphorus availability, measured in situ. The maximum rate of carboxylation standardized to 25 °C ( V cmax25 ) was found to be proportional to growing-season irradiance, and to increase—as predicted—towards both colder and drier climates. Individual species' departures from predicted V cmax25 covaried with area-based leaf nitrogen ( N area ) but community-mean V cmax25 was unrelated to N area , which in turn was unrelated to the soil C:N ratio. In contrast, leaves with low area-based phosphorus ( P area ) had low V cmax25 (both between and within communities), and P area increased with total soil P. These findings do not support the assumption, adopted in some ecosystem and Earth System models, that leaf-level photosynthetic capacity depends on soil N supply. They do, however, support a previously-noted relationship between photosynthesis and soil P supply.},

abstract = {In unpolluted regions, where inorganic nitrogen (N) inputs from the atmosphere are minimal, such as remote locations in southern South America, litterfall dynamics and N use efficiency of tree species should be coupled to the internal N cycle of forest ecosystems. This hypothesis was examined in two evergreen temperate forests in southern Chile (42 30S), a mixed broad-leaved forest (MBF) and a conifer forest (CF). Although these forests grow under the same climate and on the same parental material, they differ greatly in floristic structure and canopy dynamics (slower in the CF). In both forests, biomass, N flux, and C/N ratios of fine litterfall were measured monthly from May 1995 to March 1999. There was a continuous litter flux over the annual cycle in both forests, with a peak during autumn in the CF. In the MBF, litterfall decreased during spring. In both forests, the C/N ratios of litterfall varied over the annual cycle with a maximum in autumn. Annual litterfall biomass flux (Mean ± SD = 3.3 ± 0.5 vs 2.0 ± 0.5 Mg ha–1 ) and N return (34.8 ± 16 vs 9.1 ± 2.8 kg N ha–1 ) were higher in the MBF than in the CF. At the ecosystem level, litterfall C/N was lower in the MBF (mean C/N ratio = 60.1 ± 15, n = 3 years) suggesting decreased N use efficiency compared with CF (mean C/N ratio = 103 ± 19.6, n = 3 years). At the species level, subordinated (subcanopy) tree species in the MBF had significantly lower C/N ratios (<50) of litterfall than the dominant trees in the CF and MBF (>85). The litterfall C/N ratio and percentage N retranslocated were significantly correlated and were lower in the MBF. The higher net N mineralization in soils of the MBF is related to a lower N use efficiency at the ecosystem and species level.},

abstract = {Plant nitrogen acquisition requires carbon to be allocated belowground to build roots and sustain microbial associations. This carbon cost to acquire nitrogen varies by nitrogen acquisition strategy; however, the degree to which these costs vary due to nitrogen availability or demand has not been well tested under controlled conditions. We grew a species capable of forming associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Glycine max) and a species not capable of forming such associations (Gossypium hirsutum) under four soil nitrogen levels to manipulate nitrogen availability and four light levels to manipulate nitrogen demand in a full-factorial greenhouse experiment. We quantified carbon costs to acquire nitrogen as the ratio of total root carbon to whole-plant nitrogen within each treatment combination. In both species, light availability increased carbon costs due to a larger increase in root carbon than whole-plant nitrogen, while nitrogen fertilization generally decreased carbon costs due to a larger increase in whole-plant nitrogen than root carbon. Nodulation data indicated that G. max shifted relative carbon allocation from nitrogen fixation to direct uptake with increased nitrogen fertilization. These findings suggest that carbon costs to acquire nitrogen are modified by changes in light and nitrogen availability in species with and without associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.},

abstract = {Microbial communities have a central role in ecosystem processes by driving the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. However, the importance of microbial diversity for ecosystem functioning is still debated. Here, we experimentally manipulated the soil microbial community using a dilution approach to analyze the functional consequences of diversity loss. A trait-centered approach was embraced using the denitrifiers as model guild due to their role in nitrogen cycling, a major ecosystem service. How various diversity metrics related to richness, eveness and phylogenetic diversity of the soil denitrifier community were affected by the removal experiment was assessed by 454 sequencing. As expected, the diversity metrics indicated a decrease in diversity in the 1/10 3 and 1/10 5 dilution treatments compared with the undiluted one. However, the extent of dilution and the corresponding reduction in diversity were not commensurate, as a dilution of five orders of magnitude resulted in a 75% decrease in estimated richness. This reduction in denitrifier diversity resulted in a significantly lower potential denitrification activity in soil of up to 4-5 folds. Addition of wheat residues significantly increased differences in potential denitrification between diversity levels, indicating that the resource level can influence the shape of the microbial diversity-functioning relationship. This study shows that microbial diversity loss can alter terrestrial ecosystem processes, which suggests that the importance of functional redundancy in soil microbial communities has been overstated. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

abstract = {Understanding the context dependence of ecosystem responses to global changes requires the development of new conceptual frameworks. Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C-nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant-soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 187-194 The degree to which rising atmospheric CO2 will be offset by carbon (C) sequestration in forests depends in part on the capacity of trees and soil microbes to make physiological adjustments that can alleviate resource limitation. Here, we show for the first time that mature trees exposed to CO2 enrichment increase the release of soluble C from roots to soil, and that such increases are coupled to the accelerated turnover of nitrogen (N) pools in the rhizosphere. Over the course of 3years, we measured in situ rates of root exudation from 420 intact loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) roots. Trees fumigated with elevated CO2 (200 p.p.m.v. over background) increased exudation rates ($\mu$gCcm-1rooth-1) by 55% during the primary growing season, leading to a 50% annual increase in dissolved organic inputs to fumigated forest soils. These increases in root-derived C were positively correlated with microbial release of extracellular enzymes involved in breakdown of organic N (R2=0.66; P=0.006) in the rhizosphere, indicating that exudation stimulated microbial activity and accelerated the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover. In support of this conclusion, trees exposed to both elevated CO2 and N fertilization did not increase exudation rates and had reduced enzyme activities in the rhizosphere. Collectively, our results provide field-based empirical support suggesting that sustained growth responses of forests to elevated CO2 in low fertility soils are maintained by enhanced rates of microbial activity and N cycling fuelled by inputs of root-derived C. To the extent that increases in exudation also stimulate SOM decomposition, such changes may prevent soil C accumulation in forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The first trifoliate of soybean was shaded when fully expanded, while the plant remained in high light; a situation representative for plants growing in a closed crop. Leaf mass and respiration rate per unit area declined sharply in the first few days upon shading and remained rather constant during the further 12 days of the shading treatment. Leaf nitrogen per unit area decreased gradually until the leaves were shed. Leaf senescence was enhanced by the shading treatment in contrast to control plants growing in low light. Shaded leaves on plants grown at low nutrient availability senesced earlier than shaded leaves on plants grown at high nutrient availability. The light saturated rate of photosynthesis decreased also gradually during the shading treatment, but somewhat faster than leaf N, whereas chlorophyll contents declined somewhat slower than leaf N. Partitioning of N in the leaf over main photosynthetic functions was estimated from parameters derived from the response of photosynthesis to CO2. It appeared that the N exported from the leaf was more at the expense of compounds that make up photosynthetic capacity than of those involved in photon absorption, resulting in a change in partitioning of N within the photosynthetic apparatus. Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency increased during the shading treatment, which was for the largest part due to the decrease in leaf N content, to some extent to the decrease in respiration rate and only for a small part to change in partitioning of N within the photosynthetic apparatus.

abstract = {The majority of experiments in plant biology use plants grown in some kind of container or pot. We conducted a meta-analysis on 65 studies that analysed the effect of pot size on growth and underlying variables. On average, a doubling of the pot size increased biomass production by 43%. Further analysis of pot size effects on the underlying components of growth suggests that reduced growth in smaller pots is caused mainly by a reduction in photosynthesis per unit leaf area, rather than by changes in leaf morphology or biomass allocation. The appropriate pot size will logically depend on the size of the plants growing in them. Based on various lines of evidence we suggest that an appropriate pot size is one in which the plant biomass does not exceed 1gL-1. In current research practice ∼65% of the experiments exceed that threshold. We suggest that researchers need to carefully consider the pot size in their experiments, as small pots may change experimental results and defy the purpose of the experiment. {\textcopyright} 2012 CSIRO.},

abstract = {Generalised dose–response curves are essential to understand how plants acclimate to atmospheric CO2. We carried out a meta-analysis of 630 experiments in which C3 plants were experimentally grown at different [CO2] under relatively benign conditions, and derived dose–response curves for 85 phenotypic traits. These curves were characterised by form, plasticity, consistency and reliability. Considered over a range of 200–1200 µmol mol−1 CO2, some traits more than doubled (e.g. area-based photosynthesis; intrinsic water-use efficiency), whereas others more than halved (area-based transpiration). At current atmospheric [CO2], 64% of the total stimulation in biomass over the 200–1200 µmol mol−1 range has already been realised. We also mapped the trait responses of plants to [CO2] against those we have quantified before for light intensity. For most traits, CO2 and light responses were of similar direction. However, some traits (such as reproductive effort) only responded to light, others (such as plant height) only to [CO2], and some traits (such as area-based transpiration) responded in opposite directions. This synthesis provides a comprehensive picture of plant responses to [CO2] at different integration levels and offers the quantitative dose–response curves that can be used to improve global change simulation models.},

abstract = {By means of meta-analyses we determined how 70 traits related to plant anatomy, morphology, chemistry, physiology, growth and reproduction are affected by daily light integral (DLI; mol photons m−2 d−1). A large database including 500 experiments with 760 plant species enabled us to determine generalized dose–response curves. Many traits increase with DLI in a saturating fashion. Some showed a more than 10-fold increase over the DLI range of 1–50 mol m−2 d−1, such as the number of seeds produced per plant and the actual rate of photosynthesis. Strong decreases with DLI (up to three-fold) were observed for leaf area ratio and leaf payback time. Plasticity differences among species groups were generally small compared with the overall responses to DLI. However, for a number of traits, including photosynthetic capacity and realized growth, we found woody and shade-tolerant species to have lower plasticity. We further conclude that the direction and degree of trait changes adheres with responses to plant density and to vertical light gradients within plant canopies. This synthesis provides a strong quantitative basis for understanding plant acclimation to light, from molecular to whole plant responses, but also identifies the variables that currently form weak spots in our knowledge, such as respiration and reproductive characteristics.},

abstract = {Differences in nutrient acquisition pathways between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are associated with greater soil organic matter accumulation and reduced inorganic nitrogen (N) availability in EM-dominated forests. These plant–soil feedbacks are expected to influence seedling recruitment and the maintenance of diversity. Montane forests of Central America are characterized by a mosaic of AM and EM dominance. We used a seedling transplant and soil manipulation experiment on Volc{\'{a}}n Bar{\'{u}}, Panama, to evaluate whether patches of oak (EM-dominated) forest and mixed (AM-dominated) forest affect seedling growth. We predicted that (a) plant–soil feedbacks would result in lower soil inorganic N availability in oak than in mixed forests, (b) consequently AM seedlings would grow more slowly and have lower foliar N concentrations in oak forest and (c) dependence of EM seedlings on organic N uptake via mycorrhiza would mean that inorganic N addition would increase seedling performance for AM but not EM (i.e. oak) seedlings. As soil organic matter accumulation may affect seedling performance beyond altering nutrient supply, we also tested whether organic matter removal differentially affected AM and EM seedlings. Nitrogen availability was six times lower and the soil organic layer three times deeper in oak-dominated stands compared to mixed stands. Foliar N was lower for AM seedlings growing in oak than in mixed forest, but did not differ for oak seedlings and was increased only marginally by N addition for both AM and EM seedlings growing in both AM and EM forests. Seedling growth did not respond to N addition or organic matter removal. However, AM seedlings generally grew slower in oak forest compared with AM forest, consistent with lower foliar N concentration and low-light availability. These results suggest that changes in soil nitrogen availability have a limited effect on seedling growth. In the neotropics, EM tree communities occur at high elevation. Future upslope migration of trees may result in AM-dominated tree communities encountering unfavourable soil conditions generated by EM-dominated canopies. While longer term experiments are needed, our results suggest that AM seedlings may not be able to tolerate conditions associated with EM forest.

abstract = {Drylands, a critical terrestrial system of the Earth due to low water availability, are known for their extensive global reach, estimated by most scientific sources at approximately 41% of the world's land area, or $\sim$ 60 mil km2. However, the analysis of the global dryland areas, using new climate data, suggests a total of $\sim$ 45% of the Earth's terrestrial area, almost 7 mil km2 more than initially estimated. This new spatial dimension involves a wide range of environmental issues, some of which have yet to be associated with these critical global systems. This paper primarily aims to accurately quantify the global, continental and national extent of drylands by using a high-resolution climate database presently available at global level. Also, based on relevant scientific literature, this approach attempts to briefly highlight the main environmental issues (natural and anthropogenic) of the major continental and regional dryland areas. In this respect, special attention was given to the land degradation processes (water and wind erosion, vegetation degradation, salinization, soil compaction and nutrient loss), as it is known to be the main environmental perturbation in almost all dryland systems. Research shows that, given the fact that Africa and Asia have the most extensive dryland systems on Earth (each of them has almost 23 mil km2, or $\sim$ 15% of the global land area), these continents are especially threatened by major environmental perturbations (desertification, in addition to other ecological and climatic disturbances such as drought, dust storms, heat waves, water stress, extreme rainfall events, wildfire, dzud, or disease emergence), which are currently affecting 46 African states (37% of the 126 states affected by aridity worldwide) and 38 Asian states (30%). Given this context, anthropogenic systems are indirectly severely threatened by the crisis generated by soaring poverty, food insecurity, population migration, and escalating conflicts and regional political instability. Moreover, in the current context of large-scale aridity identified at high latitudes, another critical threat reviewed was the cryosphere's destabilization, which can potentially accelerate climate warming by means of positive feedback mechanisms that can be triggered in the global climate system. In this respect, a major concern is attributed to permafrost melting that, against the background of a significant expansion in the terrestrial northern hemisphere (in Russia, Alaska and Canada), can generate a massive acceleration of climate warming due to the potential release of large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which are currently stored in these frozen soils in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.},

abstract = {The objective of this experiment was to understand how atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and soil-nitrogen (N) availability influence Populus tremuloides fine-root growth and morphology. Soil-N availability may limit the growth response of forests to elevated CO2 and interact with atmospheric CO2 to alter litter quality and ecosystem carbon (C) and N cycling. We established a CO2 x N factorial field experiment and grew six genotypes of P. tremuloides for 2.5 growing seasons in 20 large open-top chamber/root-box experimental units at the University of Michigan Biological Station in northern lower Michigan (USA). In this paper we describe an integrated examination of how atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability influence fine-root morphology, growth, mortality, and biomass. We also studied the relationship between root biomass and total soil respiration. Over 80% of the absorbing root length of P. tremuloides was accounted for by roots <0.4 mm in diameter, and specific root length (100-250 m/g) was much greater than reports for other temperate and boreal deciduous trees. Elevated atmospheric CO2 increased the diameter and length of individual roots. In contrast, soil N had no effect on root morphology. Fine-root length production and mortality, measured with minirhizotrons, was controlled by the interaction between atmospheric CO2 and soil N. Rates of root production and mortality were significantly greater at elevated CO2 when trees grew in high-N soil, but there were no CO2 effects at low soil N. Fine-root biomass increased 137-194% in high-N compared to low-N soil, and elevated atmospheric CO2 increased fine-root biomass (52%) in high soil N, but differences in low soil N were not significant. Across all treatments, dynamic estimates of net fine-root production were highly correlated with fine-root biomass (soil cores; r = 0.975). Mean rates of soil respiration were more than double in high-N compared to low-N soil, and elevated atmospheric CO2, when compared to ambient atmospheric CO2, increased mean rates of soil respiration 19% in 1995 and 25% in 1996. Across all treatments, total root biomass was linearly related to mean rates of soil respiration (r2 = 0.96). Our results indicate that atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability strongly interact to influence P. tremuloides fine-root morphology, growth, and C turnover. Aspen-dominated ecosystems of the future are likely to have greater productivity fueled by greater nutrient uptake due to greater root length production. Further, it appears that elevated atmospheric CO2 will result in greater C inputs to soil through greater rates of fine-root production and turnover, especially in high-fertility soils. Increased C inputs to soil result in greater rates of soil respiration. At this time, it is not clear what effects increased rates of root turnover will have on C storage in the soil.},

abstract = {A novel framework is presented for the analysis of ecophysiological field measurements and modelling. The hypothesis ‘leaves minimise the summed unit costs of transpiration and carboxylation' predicts leaf-internal/ambient CO 2 ratios (c i/c a) and slopes of maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax ) or leaf nitrogen (Narea ) vs. stomatal conductance. Analysis of data on woody species from contrasting climates (cold-hot, dry-wet) yielded steeper slopes and lower mean c i /c a ratios at the dry or cold sites than at the wet or hot sites. High atmospheric vapour pressure deficit implies low c i / c a in dry climates. High water viscosity (more costly transport) and low photorespiration (less costly photosynthesis) imply low c i /ca in cold climates. Observed site-mean c i /c a shifts are pre- dicted quantitatively for temperature contrasts (by photorespiration plus viscosity effects) and approximately for aridity contrasts. The theory explains the dependency of c i /ca ratios on temper- ature and vapour pressure deficit, and observed relationships of leaf d13 C and Narea to aridity},

abstract = {The least-cost economic theory of photosynthesis shows that water and nitrogen are mutually substitutable resources to achieve a given carbon gain. However, vegetation in the Sahel has to cope with the dual challenge imposed by drought and nutrient-poor soils. We addressed how variation in leaf nitrogen per area (Narea) modulates leaf oxygen and carbon isotopic composition ($\delta$18O, $\delta$13C), as proxies of stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency, across 34 Sahelian woody species. Dryland species exhibited diverging leaf $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C values, indicating large interspecific variation in time-integrated stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency. Structural equation modeling revealed that leaf Narea is a pivotal trait linked to multiple water-use traits. Leaf Narea was positively linked to both $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C, suggesting higher carboxylation capacity and tighter stomatal regulation of transpiration in N-rich species, which allows them to achieve higher water-use efficiency and more conservative water use. These adaptations represent a key physiological advantage of N-rich species, such as legumes, that could contribute to their dominance across many dryland regions. This is the first report of a robust mechanistic link between leaf Narea and $\delta$18O in dryland vegetation that is consistent with core principles of plant physiology.},

abstract = {Plants often adjust their leaf mitochondrial (“dark”) respiration (Rd) measured at a standardized temperature such as 20°C (R20) downward after experiencing warmer temperatures and upward after experiencing cooler temperatures. These responses may help leaves maintain advantageous photosynthetic capacity and/or be a response to recent photosynthate accumulation, and can occur within days after a change in thermal regime. It is not clear, however, how the sensitivity and magnitude of this response change over time, or which time period prior to a given measurement best predicts R20. Nor is it known whether nighttime, daytime, or 24-hour temperatures should be most influential. To address these issues, we used data from 1620 Rd temperature response curves of 10 temperate and boreal tree species in a long–term field experiment in Minnesota, USA to assess how the observed nearly complete acclimation of R20 was related to past temperatures during periods of differing lengths. We hypothesized that R20 would be best related to prior midday temperatures associated with both photosynthetic biochemistry and peak carbon uptake rates that drive carbohydrate accumulation. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, prior night temperatures were the best predictors of R20 for all species. We had also hypothesized that recent (prior 3–10 days) temperatures should best predict R20 because they likely have stronger residual impacts on leaf-level physiology than periods extending further back in time, whereas a prior 1- to 2-day period might be a span shorter than one to which photosynthetic capacity and Rd adjust. There was little to no support for this idea, as for angiosperms, long time windows (prior 30–60 nights) were the best predictors, while for gymnosperms both near-term (prior 3–8 nights for pines, prior 10–14 nights for spruce/fir) and longer-term periods (prior 45 nights) were the best predictors. The importance of nighttime temperatures, the relatively long “time-averaging” that best explained acclimation, and dual peaks of temporal acclimation responsiveness in some species were all results that were unanticipated.},

The management and need for reclamation of saline soils are evaluated from measurements of such concentrations. The appropriate method of measuring soil salinity must be selected for the specific condition and purpose. To monitor soil water salinity as the soil dries between irrigations, the salinity sensor is recommended. When determination of a particular solute is needed, then either collection or extraction of soil samples or collection of water samples is required. For some needs, knowing the composition of solutes in soil water at field water contents is desirable. However, present methods of obtaining soil water samples at usual field water contents are not practical for routine purposes. For these reasons, crop tolerance to salinity is often related to the electrical conductivity, or total electrolyte concentration, of the saturation extract.},

abstract = {Mycorrhizae, due to their key position at the plant-soil interface, are impor- tant to consider in the study of ecosystem impacts of global changes.Human- induced changes in the earth's environment are clearly multi-factorial.Exam- ples of important factors are: elevated concentrations of atmospheric gases (for example carbon dioxide or ozone), increased input of nutrients into ecosystems by atmospheric deposition (for example nitrogen), climate change (including altered precipitation and temperature regimes), invasivespecies,and increased UV-radiation.All of these components of future or pre- sent global changes can have positive or negative impacts on mycorrhizal associations. However, a more fundamental distinction has to be made between these factors, paying tribute to the fact that in the mycorrhizal sym- biosis we are dealing with two classes of organisms with partially indepen- dent biology. There are those factors that directly affect only the host plant (e.g., carbon fixation), and that only have indirect effects on mycorrhizal fungi (mycobionts) via altered carbon allocation from the host. Examples include atmospheric changes, against which soil serves largely as a buffer. Other factors can (in addition) directly affect the mycobionts, for example warming or altered precipitation. This distinction is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of the impact of global change factors, and for experimental approaches.Global change factors rarely occur in isolation.The complexity of regional combinations of global change factors further highlights the need for mechanistic studies, since direct experimental exploration of a large number of scenarios would be virtually impossible. Finally, processes and patterns at larger temporal and spatial scales have to be considered in an assessment of global change impacts on mycorrhiza.Most experiments only allow access to short-term responses,while longer-term responses are really relevant. Possi- ble approaches include the use of natural experiments, for example, CO2 springs.Large-scale processes such as shifts in the global distribution of plant communities (or their regional extinction) due to climate change would affect mycorrhiza, for example, alter the current distribution of mycorrhizal types on the globe.With potential impacts on host biodiversity,mycobiont species diversity may also be impacted at regional scales. In addition, changes in the mycorrhizal fungal community that are independent of changes in the plant community may be one of the least-understood, but potentially most impor- tant,mycorrhizal responses to global change.},

abstract = {Plant–soil systems are key for understanding the effects of factors of global change. Recent work has highlighted the general importance of considering the simultaneous incidence of some factors or stressors. To help mechanistically dissect the possible interactions of such factors, we here propose three broad groups of mechanisms that may generally lead to nonadditivity of responses within a plant–soil system: direct factor interactions (that is one factor directly changing another), within-plant information processing and crosstalk, and effects of factors on groups of soil biota interacting with plants. Interactions are also possible within and across these groups. Factor interactions are very likely to be present in experiments, especially when dealing with an increasing number of factors. Identifying the nature of such interactions will be essential for understanding and predicting global change impacts on plants and soil.},

abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis alleviates drought stress in plants. However, the intimate mechanisms involved, as well as its effect on the production of signalling molecules associated with the host plant-AM fungus interaction remains largely unknown. In the present work, the effects of drought on lettuce and tomato plant performance and hormone levels were investigated in non-AM and AM plants. Three different water regimes were applied, and their effects were analysed over time. AM plants showed an improved growth rate and efficiency of photosystem II than non-AM plants under drought from very early stages of plant colonization. The levels of the phytohormone abscisic acid, as well as the expression of the corresponding marker genes, were influenced by drought stress in non-AM and AM plants. The levels of strigolactones and the expression of corresponding marker genes were affected by both AM symbiosis and drought. The results suggest that AM symbiosis alleviates drought stress by altering the hormonal profiles and affecting plant physiology in the host plant. In addition, a correlation between AM root colonization, strigolactone levels and drought severity is shown, suggesting that under these unfavourable conditions, plants might increase strigolactone production in order to promote symbiosis establishment to cope with the stress.},

abstract = {Leaf level gas exchange is a widely used technique that provides real-time measurement of leaf physiological properties, including CO2 assimilation (A), stomatal conductance to water vapour (gsw) and intercellular CO2 (Ci). Modern open-path gas exchange systems offer greater portability than the laboratory-built systems of the past and take advantage of high-precision infrared gas analyzers and optimized system design. However, the basic measurement paradigm has long required steady-state conditions for accurate measurement. For CO2 response curves, this requirement has meant that each point on the curve needs 1–3 min and a full response curve generally requires 20–35 min to obtain a sufficient number of points to estimate parameters such as the maximum velocity of carboxylation (Vc,max) and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax). For survey measurements, the steady-state requirement has meant that accurate measurement of assimilation has required about 1–2 min. However, steady-state conditions are not a strict prerequisite for accurate gas exchange measurements. Here, we present a new method, termed dynamic assimilation, that is based on first principles and allows for more rapid gas exchange measurements, helping to make the technique more useful for high throughput applications.},

abstract = {We review the current understanding of the temperature responses of C3 and C4 photosynthesis across thermal ranges that do not harm the photosynthetic apparatus. In C3 species, photosynthesis is classically considered to be limited by the capacities of ribulose 1{\textperiodcentered}5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration or Pi regeneration. Using both theoretical and empirical evidence, we describe the temperature response of instantaneous net CO2 assimilation rate (A) in terms of these limitations, and evaluate possible limitations on A at elevated temperatures arising from heat-induced lability of Rubisco activase. In C3 plants, Rubisco capacity is the predominant limitation on A across a wide range of temperatures at low CO2 (<300 µbar), while at elevated CO2, the limitation shifts to Pi regeneration capacity at suboptimal temperatures, and either electron transport capacity or Rubisco activase capacity at supraoptimal temperatures. In C4 plants, Rubisco capacity limits A below 20 °C in chilling-tolerant species, but the control over A at elevated temperature remains uncertain. Acclimation of C3 photosynthesis to suboptimal growth temperature is commonly associated with a disproportional enhancement of the Pi regeneration capacity. Above the thermal optimum, acclimation of A to increasing growth temperature is associated with increased electron transport capacity and/or greater heat stability of Rubisco activase. In many C4 species from warm habitats, acclimation to cooler growth conditions increases levels of Rubisco and C4 cycle enzymes which then enhance A below the thermal optimum. By contrast, few C4 species adapted to cooler habitats increase Rubisco content during acclimation to reduced growth temperature; as a result, A changes little at suboptimal temperatures. Global change is likely to cause a widespread shift in patterns of photosynthetic limitation in higher plants. Limitations in electron transport and Rubisco activase capacity should be more common in the warmer, high CO2 conditions expected by the end of the century.},

abstract = {Hydrologic analyses often involve the evaluation of soil water in- filtration, conductivity, storage, and plant-water relationships. To de- fine the hydrologic soil water effects requires estimating soil water characteristics for water potential and hydraulic conductivity using soil variables such as texture, organic matter (OM), and structure. Field or laboratory measurements are difficult, costly, and often impractical for many hydrologic analyses. Statistical correlations between soil texture, soil water potential, and hydraulic conductivity can provide estimates sufficiently accurate for many analyses and decisions. This study de- veloped new soil water characteristic equations from the currently available USDA soil database using only the readily available vari- ables of soil texture and OM. These equations are similar to those previously reported by Saxton et al. but include more variables and application range. They were combined with previously reported rela- tionships for tensions and conductivities and the effects of density, gravel, and salinity to form a comprehensive predictive system of soil water characteristics for agricultural water management and hydro- logic analyses. Verification was performed using independent data sets for a wide range of soil textures. The predictive system was pro- grammed for a graphical computerized model to provide easy appli- cation and rapid solutions and is available at http://hydrolab.arsusda. gov/soilwater/Index.htm.},

abstract = {Empirical studies have shown that plant photosynthetic responses to environmental change can vary over time due to acclimation, but acclimation responses are often not included in Earth System Models. Photosynthetic least cost theory can be used to develop models of photosynthetic acclimation that are simple and testable. The theory is based on the idea that plants will acclimate to minimize the ratio of carbon costs to photosynthetic assimilation rate (Prentice et al., 2014, https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12211). Formulations of this theory have been developed for C3 plants, but not C4 plants, which account for over 20% of global photosynthesis and are over-represented among widely grown crops. Here, we use photosynthetic least cost theory to derive a model for C4 photosynthetic acclimation to above-ground abiotic conditions. We then compare our model's responses to a similar model of C3 photosynthetic acclimation and find that C4 photosynthesis has the highest simulated advantage over C3 photosynthesis in hot, dry, and low CO2 environments. We find that this advantage predicts C4 abundance globally, but that the shallower CO2 response of C4 as compared to C3 photosynthesis will reduce C4 plant competitiveness under future conditions, despite higher temperatures. We also show that an acclimated model predicts similar or faster rates of C4 under all conditions than a model that does not consider acclimation, suggesting that Earth System Models (ESMs) are underestimating future C4 carbon uptake by not including acclimation. Our model is designed for easy incorporation into such ESMs.},

abstract = {Eight Earth System Models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are evaluated, focusing on both the net carbon dioxide flux and its components and their relation with climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture) in the historical (1850–2005) and representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5; 2006–2100) simulations. While model results differ, their median globally averaged production and respiration terms from 1976 to 2005 agree reasonably with available observation-based products. Disturbances such as land use change are roughly represented but crucial in determining whether the land is a carbon source or sink over many regions in both simulations. While carbon fluxes vary with latitude and between the two simulations, the ratio of net to gross primary production, representing the ecosystem carbon use efficiency, is less dependent on latitude and does not differ significantly in the historical and RCP4.5 simulations. The linear trend of increased land carbon fluxes (except net ecosystem production) is accelerated in the twenty-first century. The cumulative net ecosystem production by 2100 is positive (i.e., carbon sink) in all models and the tropical and boreal latitudes become major carbon sinks in most models. The temporal correlations between annual-mean carbon cycle and climate variables vary substantially (including the change of sign) among the eight models in both the historical and twenty-first-century simulations. The ranges of correlations of carbon cycle variables with precipitation and soil moisture are also quite different, reflecting the important impact of the model treatment of the hydrological cycle on the carbon cycle.},

abstract = {The $\sim$SN abundance of plants usually closely reflects the ISN abundance of their major immediate N source(s); plant-available soil N in the case of non-N2-fixing plants and atmospheric N 2 in the case of N2fixing plants. The $\sim$SN abundance values of these sources are usually sufficiently different from each other that a significant and systematic difference in the $\sim$SN abundance between the two kinds of plants can be detected. This difference provides the basis for the natural $\sim$SN abundance method of estimating the relative contribution of atmospheric N 2 to N 2-fixing plants growing in natural and agricultural settings. The natural 15N abundance method has certain advantages over more conventional methods, particularly in natural ecosystems, since disturbance of the system is not required and the measurements may be made on samples dried in the field. This method has been tested mainly with legumes in agricultural settings. The tests have demonstrated the validity of this method of arriving at semi-quantitative estimates of biological N 2-fixation in these settings. More limited tests and applications have been made for legumes in natural ecosystems. An understanding of the limits and utility of this method in these systems is beginning to emerge. Examples of systematic measurements of differences in $\sim$SN abundance beween non-legume Nz-fixing systems and neighbouring non-fixing systems are more unusual. In principle, application of the method to estimate N 2-fixation by nodulated non-legumes, using the natural $\sim$SN abundance method, is as feasible as estimating N2-fixation by legumes. Most of the studies involving N2-fixing non-legumes are with this type of system (e.g., Ceanothus, Chamabatia, Eleagnus, Alnus, Myrica, and so forth). Results of these studies are described. Applicability for associative N2-fixation is an empirical question, the answer to which probably depends upon the degree to which fixed N goes predominantly to the plant rather than to the soil N pool. The natural tSN abundance method is probably not well suited to assessing the contribution of N 2-fixation by free-living microorganisms in their natural habitat, particularly soil microorganisms.},

abstract = {Plants typically expend a significant portion of their available carbon (C) on nutrient acquisition - C that could otherwise support growth. However, given that most global terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) do not include the C cost of nutrient acquisition, these models fail to represent current and future constraints to the land C sink. Here, we integrated a plant productivity-optimized nutrient acquisition model - the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen Model - into one of the most widely used TBMs, the Community Land Model. Global plant nitrogen (N) uptake is dynamically simulated in the coupled model based on the C costs of N acquisition from mycorrhizal roots, nonmycorrhizal roots, N-fixing microbes, and retranslocation (from senescing leaves). We find that at the global scale, plants spend 2.4 Pg C yr-1 to acquire 1.0 Pg N yr-1, and that the C cost of N acquisition leads to a downregulation of global net primary production (NPP) by 13%. Mycorrhizal uptake represented the dominant pathway by which N is acquired, accounting for $\sim$66% of the N uptake by plants. Notably, roots associating with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi - generally considered for their role in phosphorus (P) acquisition - are estimated to be the primary source of global plant N uptake owing to the dominance of AM-associated plants in mid- and low-latitude biomes. Overall, our coupled model improves the representations of NPP downregulation globally and generates spatially explicit patterns of belowground C allocation, soil N uptake, and N retranslocation at the global scale. Such model improvements are critical for predicting how plant responses to altered N availability (owing to N deposition, rising atmospheric CO2, and warming temperatures) may impact the land C sink.},

abstract = {The LPJ-GUESS dynamic vegetation model uniquely combines an individual- and patch-based representation of vegetation dynamics with ecosystem biogeochemical cycling from regional to global scales. We present an updated version that includes plant and soil N dynamics, analysing the implications of accounting for C-N interactions on predictions and performance of the model. Stand structural dynamics and allometric scaling of tree growth suggested by global databases of forest stand structure and development were well reproduced by the model in comparison to an earlier multi-model study. Accounting for N cycle dynamics improved the goodness of fit for broadleaved forests. N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates reduces productivity of cold-climate and dry-climate ecosystems relative to mesic temperate and tropical ecosystems. In a model experiment emulating free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) treatment for forests globally, N limitation associated with low N-mineralisation rates of colder soils reduces CO2 enhancement of net primary production (NPP) for boreal forests, while some temperate and tropical forests exhibit increased NPP enhancement. Under a business-as-usual future climate and emissions scenario, ecosystem C storage globally was projected to increase by ca. 10%; additional N requirements to match this increasing ecosystem C were within the high N supply limit estimated on stoichiometric grounds in an earlier study. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for C-N interactions in studies of global terrestrial N cycling, and as a basis for understanding mechanisms on local scales and in different regional contexts. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {Symbiosis is well recognized as a major force in plant ecology and evolution. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the functional, ecological and evolutionary benefits of the very widespread facultative arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations, in which the plants can grow and reproduce whether or not they are colonized by AM fungi. Here we address the significance of new research findings that are overturning conventional views that facultative AM associations can be likened to parasitic fungus-plant associations. Specifically, we address the occurrence and importance of phosphate uptake via AM fungi that does not result in increases in total phosphorus (P) uptake or in plant growth, and possible signalling between AM fungi and plants that can result in plant growth depressions even when fungal colonization remains very low. We conclude that, depending on the individual AM fungi that are present, the role of facultative AM associations in the field, especially in relation to plant competition, may be much more subtle than has been previously envisaged.},

abstract = {Realistic representations of plant carbon exchange processes are necessary to reliably simulate biosphere–atmosphere feedbacks. These processes are known to vary over time and space, though the drivers of the underlying rates are still widely debated in the literature. Here, we measured leaf carbon exchange in >500 individuals of 98 species from the Neotropics to high boreal biomes to determine the drivers of photosynthetic and dark respiration capacity. Covariate abiotic (long- and short-term climate) and biotic (plant type, plant size, ontogeny, water status) data were used to explore significant drivers of temperature-standardized leaf carbon exchange rates. Using model selection, we found the previous week's temperature and soil moisture at the time of measurement to be a better predictor of photosynthetic capacity than long-term climate, with the combination of high recent temperatures and low soil moisture tending to decrease photosynthetic capacity. Non-trees (annual and perennials) tended to have greater photosynthetic capacity than trees, and, within trees, adults tended to have greater photosynthetic capacity than juveniles, possibly as a result of differences in light availability. Dark respiration capacity was less responsive to the assessed drivers than photosynthetic capacity, with rates best predicted by multi-year average site temperature alone. Our results suggest that, across large spatial scales, photosynthetic capacity quickly adjusts to changing environmental conditions, namely light, temperature, and soil moisture. Respiratory capacity is more conservative and most responsive to longer-term conditions. Our results provide a framework for incorporating these processes into large-scale models and a data set to benchmark such models.},

abstract = {The mechanisms responsible for photosynthetic acclimation are not well understood, effectively limiting predictability under future conditions. Least-cost optimality the- ory can be used to predict the acclimation of photosynthetic capacity based on the assumption that plants maximize carbon uptake while minimizing the associated costs. Here, we use this theory as a null model in combination with multiple datasets of C3 plant photosynthetic traits to elucidate the mechanisms underlying photosyn- thetic acclimation to elevated temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2). The model-data comparison showed that leaves decrease the ratio of the maximum rate of electron transport to the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Jmax/Vcmax) under higher temperatures. The comparison also indicated that resources used for Rubisco and electron transport are reduced under both elevated temperature and CO2. Finally, our analysis suggested that plants underinvest in electron transport relative to car- boxylation under elevated CO2, limiting potential leaf-level photosynthesis under future CO2 concentrations. Altogether, our results show that acclimation to tempera- ture and CO2 is primarily related to resource conservation at the leaf level. Under fu- ture,},

In contrast, new theory, based on biochemical coordination and co-optimization of carboxylation and water costs for photosynthesis, suggests that optimal Vcmax can be predicted from climate alone, irrespective of soil fertility. Here, we develop this theory and find it captures 64% of observed variability in a global, field-measured Vcmax dataset for C3 plants. Soil fertility indices explained substantially less variation (32%). These results indicate that environmentally regulated biophysical constraints and light availability are the first-order drivers of global photosynthetic capacity. Through acclimation and adaptation, plants efficiently utilize resources at the leaf level, thus maximizing potential resource use for growth and reproduction. Our theory offers a robust strategy for dynamically predicting photosynthetic capacity in ESMs.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {Plant photosynthesis and respiration are the largest carbon fluxes between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmo- sphere1, and their parameterizations represent large sources of uncertainty in projections of land carbon uptake in Earth system models2,3 (ESMs). The incorporation of temperature acclimation of photosynthesis and foliar respiration, commonly observed processes, into ESMs has been proposed as a way to reduce this uncertainty2. Here we show that, across 15 flux tower sites spanning multiple biomes at various locations worldwide (10◦ S–67◦ N), acclimation parameteri- zations4,5 improve a model's ability to reproduce observed net ecosystem exchange of CO2. This improvement is most notable in tropical biomes, where photosynthetic acclimation increased model performance by 36%. The consequences of acclimation for simulated terrestrial carbon uptake depend on the process, region and time period evaluated. Globally, including acclimation has a net effect of increasing carbon assimilation and storage, an effect that diminishes with time, but persists well into the future. Our results suggest that land models omitting foliar temperature acclimation are likely to overestimate the temperature sensitivity of terrestrial carbon exchange, thus biasing projections of future carbon storage and estimates of policy indicators such as the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions1.},

While many resources address the technical advantages and limitations of different methods for measuring BNF, less systematic consideration has been given to the broader decisions involved in planning studies, interpreting data, and extrapolating results. Here, we present a conceptual and practical road map to study design, study execution, data analysis and scaling, outlining key considerations at each step. We address issues including defining N-fixing niches of interest, identifying important sources of temporal and spatial heterogeneity, designing a sampling scheme (including method selection, measurement conditions, replication, and consideration of hotspots and hot moments), and approaches to analysing, scaling and reporting BNF. We also review the comparability of estimates derived using different approaches in the literature, and provide sample R code for simulating symbiotic BNF data frames and upscaling. Improving and standardizing study design at each of these stages will improve the accuracy and interpretability of data, define limits of extrapolation, and facilitate broader use of BNF data for downstream applications. We highlight aspects—such as quantifying scales of heterogeneity, statistical approaches for dealing with non-normality, and consideration of rates versus ecological significance—that are ripe for further development.},

Ecosystems dominated by distinct mycorrhizal types differ strongly in their biogeochemistry. Quantitative analyses of mycorrhizal impacts on ecosystem functioning are hindered by the scarcity of information on mycorrhizal distributions. Here we present global, high-resolution maps of vegetation biomass distribution by dominant mycorrhizal associations. Arbuscular, ectomycorrhizal, and ericoid mycorrhizal vegetation store, respectively, 241 ± 15, 100 ± 17, and 7 ± 1.8 GT carbon in aboveground biomass, whereas non-mycorrhizal vegetation stores 29 ± 5.5 GT carbon. Soil carbon stocks in both topsoil and subsoil are positively related to the community-level biomass fraction of ectomycorrhizal plants, though the strength of this relationship varies across biomes. We show that human-induced transformations of Earth's ecosystems have reduced ectomycorrhizal vegetation, with potential ramifications to terrestrial carbon stocks. Our work provides a benchmark for spatially explicit and globally quantitative assessments of mycorrhizal impacts on ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling.},

abstract = {Moisture may limit microbial activity in a wide range of environments including salt water, food, wood, biofilms, and soils. Low water availability can inhibit microbial activity by lowering intracellular water potential and thus reducing hydration and activity of enzymes. In solid matrices, low water content may also reduce microbial activity by restricting substrate supply. As pores within solid matrices drain and water films coating surfaces become thinner, diffusion path lengths become more tortuous, and the rate of substrate diffusion to microbial cells declines. We used two independent techniques to evaluate the relative importance of cytoplasmic dehydration versus diffusional limitations in controlling rates of nitrification in soil. Nitrification rates in shaken soil slurries, in which NH4+ was maintained at high concentrations and osmotic potential was controlled by the addition of K2SO4, were compared with rates in moist soil incubations, in which substrate supply was controlled by the addition of NH3 gas. Comparison of results from these techniques demonstrated that diffusional limitation of substrate supply and adverse physiologic effects associated with cell dehydration can explain all of the decline in activity of nitrifying bacteria at low soil water content. However, the relative importance of substrate limitation and dehydration changes at different water potentials. For the soil-microbial system we worked with, substrate limitation was the major inhibiting factor when soil water potentials were greater than -0.6 MPa, whereas adverse physiological effects associated with cell dehydration were more inhibiting at water potentials of less than -0.6 MPa.},

abstract = {The identity of the dominant root-associated microbial symbionts in a forest determines the ability of trees to access limiting nutrients from atmospheric or soil pools1,2, sequester carbon3,4 and withstand the effects of climate change5,6. Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables—in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition—are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species7, constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers—which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)—are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species.},

abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs), the efflux of CO2 from soils to the atmosphere, is a major component of the terrestrial carbon cycle, but is poorly constrained from regional to global scales. The global soil respiration database (SRDB) is a compilation of in situ Rs observations from around the globe that has been consistently updated with new measurements over the past decade. It is unclear whether the addition of data to new versions has produced better-constrained global Rs estimates. We compared two versions of the SRDB (v3.0 n = 5173 and v5.0 n = 10,366) to determine how additional data influenced global Rs annual sum, spatial patterns and associated uncertainty (1 km spatial resolution) using a machine learning approach. A quantile regression forest model parameterized using SRDBv3 yielded a global Rs sum of 88.6 Pg C year−1, and associated uncertainty of 29.9 (mean absolute error) and 57.9 (standard deviation) Pg C year−1, whereas parameterization using SRDBv5 yielded 96.5 Pg C year−1 and associated uncertainty of 30.2 (mean average error) and 73.4 (standard deviation) Pg C year−1. Empirically estimated global heterotrophic respiration (Rh) from v3 and v5 were 49.9–50.2 (mean 50.1) and 53.3–53.5 (mean 53.4) Pg C year−1, respectively. SRDBv5's inclusion of new data from underrepresented regions (e.g., Asia, Africa, South America) resulted in overall higher model uncertainty. The largest differences between models parameterized with different SRDVB versions were in arid/semi-arid regions. The SRDBv5 is still biased toward northern latitudes and temperate zones, so we tested an optimized global distribution of Rs measurements, which resulted in a global sum of 96.4 ± 21.4 Pg C year−1 with an overall lower model uncertainty. These results support current global estimates of Rs but highlight spatial biases that influence model parameterization and interpretation and provide insights for design of environmental networks to improve global-scale Rs estimates.},

abstract = {Terrestrial photosynthesis is the basis for vegetation growth and drives the land carbon cycle. Accurately simulating gross primary production (GPP, ecosystem-level apparent photosynthesis) is key for satellite monitoring and Earth system model predictions under climate change. While robust models exist for describing leaf-level photosynthesis, predictions diverge due to uncertain photosynthetic traits and parameters which vary on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we describe and evaluate a GPP (photosynthesis per unit ground area) model, the P-model, that combines the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model for C3 photosynthesis with an optimality principle for the carbon assimilation-Transpiration trade-off, and predicts a multi-day average light use efficiency (LUE) for any climate and C3 vegetation type. The model builds on the theory developed in Prentice et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2017a) and is extended to include low temperature effects on the intrinsic quantum yield and an empirical soil moisture stress factor. The model is forced with site-level data of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and meteorological data and is evaluated against GPP estimates from a globally distributed network of ecosystem flux measurements. Although the P-model requires relatively few inputs, the R2 is reduced to 0.70 when not accounting for the reduction in quantum yield at low temperatures and effects of low soil moisture on LUE. The R2 for the P-model-predicted LUE is 0.32 (means by site) and 0.48 (means by vegetation type). Applying this model for global-scale simulations yields a total global GPP of 106-122 Pg C yr-1 (mean of 2001-2011), depending on the fAPAR forcing data. The P-model provides a simple but powerful method for predicting-rather than prescribing-light use efficiency and simulating terrestrial photosynthesis across a wide range of conditions. The model is available as an R package (rpmodel).},

abstract = {Terrestrial primary productivity and carbon cycle impacts of droughts are commonly quantified using vapour pressure deficit (VPD) data and remotely sensed greenness, without accounting for soil moisture. However, soil moisture limitation is known to strongly affect plant physiology. Here, we investigate light use efficiency, the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to absorbed light. We derive its fractional reduction due to soil moisture (fLUE), separated from VPD and greenness changes, using artificial neural networks trained on eddy covariance data, multiple soil moisture datasets and remotely sensed greenness. This reveals substantial impacts of soil moisture alone that reduce GPP by up to 40% at sites located in sub-humid, semi-arid or arid regions. For sites in relatively moist climates, we find, paradoxically, a muted fLUE response to drying soil, but reduced fLUE under wet conditions. fLUE identifies substantial drought impacts that are not captured when relying solely on VPD and greenness changes and, when seasonally recurring, are missed by traditional, anomaly-based drought indices. Counter to common assumptions, fLUE reductions are largest in drought-deciduous vegetation, including grasslands. Our results highlight the necessity to account for soil moisture limitation in terrestrial primary productivity data products, especially for drought-related assessments.},

abstract = {Soils contain more carbon than plants or the atmosphere, and sensitivities of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to changing climate and plant productivity are a major uncertainty in global carbon cycle projections. Despite a consensus that microbial degradation and mineral stabilization processes control SOC cycling, no systematic synthesis of long-term warming and litter addition experiments has been used to test process-based microbe-mineral SOC models. We explored SOC responses to warming and increased carbon inputs using a synthesis of 147 field manipulation experiments and five SOC models with different representations of microbial and mineral processes. Model projections diverged but encompassed a similar range of variability as the experimental results. Experimental measurements were insufficient to eliminate or validate individual model outcomes. While all models projected that CO2 efflux would increase and SOC stocks would decline under warming, nearly one-third of experiments observed decreases in CO2 flux and nearly half of experiments observed increases in SOC stocks under warming. Long-term measurements of C inputs to soil and their changes under warming are needed to reconcile modeled and observed patterns. Measurements separating the responses of mineral-protected and unprotected SOC fractions in manipulation experiments are needed to address key uncertainties in microbial degradation and mineral stabilization mechanisms. Integrating models with experimental design will allow targeting of these uncertainties and help to reconcile divergence among models to produce more confident projections of SOC responses to global changes.},

However, it has historically been difficult to disentangle the magnitudes of VPD compared to SWC limitations on ecosystem-scale fluxes. We used a 13 year record of eddy covariance measurements from a forest in south central Indiana, USA, to quantify how transpiration and photosynthesis respond to fluctuations in VPD versus SWC. High VPD and low SWC both explained reductions in photosynthesis relative to its long-term mean, as well as reductions in transpiration relative to potential transpiration estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation. Flux responses to typical fluctuations in SWC and VPD had similar magnitudes. Integrated over the year, VPD fluctuations accounted for significant reductions of GPP in both nondrought and drought years. Our results suggest that increasing VPD under climatic warming could reduce forest CO2 uptake regardless of changes in SWC.},

abstract = {Accurate projections of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink are critical to understanding the future global C cycle and setting CO2 emission reduction goals. Current earth system models (ESMs) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) with coupled carbon-nitrogen cycles project that future terrestrial C sequestration will be limited by nitrogen (N) availability, but the magnitude of N limitation remains a critical uncertainty. Plants use multiple symbiotic nutrient acquisition strategies to mitigate N limitation, but current DGVMs omit these mechanisms. Fully coupling N-acquiring plant-microbe symbioses to soil organic matter (SOM) cycling within a DGVM for the first time, we show that increases in N acquisition via SOM decomposition and atmospheric N2 fixation could support long-term enhancement of terrestrial C sequestration at global scales under elevated CO2. The model reproduced elevated CO2 responses from two experiments (Duke and Oak Ridge) representing contrasting N acquisition strategies. N release from enhanced SOM decomposition supported vegetation growth at Duke, while inorganic N depletion limited growth at Oak Ridge. Global simulations reproduced spatial patterns of N-acquiring symbioses from a novel niche-based map of mycorrhizal fungi. Under a 100-ppm increase in CO2 concentrations, shifts in N acquisition pathways facilitated 200 Pg C of terrestrial C sequestration over 100 years compared to 50 Pg C for a scenario with static N acquisition pathways. Our results suggest that N acquisition strategies are important determinants of terrestrial C sequestration potential under elevated CO2 and that nitrogen-enabled DGVMs that omit symbiotic N acquisition may underestimate future terrestrial C uptake.},

abstract = {2016 was one of the warmest and driest summers on record throughout much of the Northeastern United States (Northeast). Additionally, historically low winter snowfall preceding the summer of 2016 exacerbated drought conditions and led to record low streamflows in some regions. Climate models suggest that short-term summer droughts could increase in frequency and continue to pose challenges to farmers and water resource managers in the Northeast. Here we focus on the impacts of the drought on farmers in New York State (NY), an economically important agricultural state in the Northeast. We found that in several regions across NY 2015-16 winter snowfall, and 2016 growing season precipitation and streamflows were near or below the 10th percentile of the previous 60 years; and 2016 air temperatures were near or above the 90th percentile of the previous 60 years. Based on survey results, more than 70% of the 275 farmers surveyed across NY reported rainfed field crop and pasture yield losses greater than 30%, with some loses over 90%. In the hardest hit Western region of NY, substantial crop losses (>30%) were reported for fruit and vegetable crops on farms with irrigation, due to limited irrigation equipment and water supplies (e.g. low streamflows, dry ponds or wells). After what they experienced in 2016, 32% of the 75 farmers in follow-up interviews invested in irrigation equipment and water sources in 2016, and 32% said they plan to do so in 2017. Thirty-two percent of farmers in follow-up interviews said they plan to take measures to improve soil health and soil organic matter to improve water holding capacity and better prepare for drought. Model estimates suggest NY state-wide crop irrigation water use could increase by 3–8 times in dry years compared to average growing seasons, increasing seasonal usage by millions of cubic meters. This highlights the potential for significant increases in water withdrawals in NY, with implications for water resources, particularly as the climate changes.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that greater photosynthate supply at elevated CO2 could compensate for increased below-ground C demands of arbuscular mycorrhizas. Therefore, we investigated plant growth, mineral nutrition, starch, and net gas exchange responses of two Citrus spp. to phosphorus (P) nutrition and mycorrhizas at elevated atmospheric CO2. Half of the seedlings of sour orange (C. aurantium L.) and `Ridge Pineapple' sweet orange (C. sinensis L. Osbeck) were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Glomus intraradices Schenck and Smith and half were non-mycorrhizal (NM). Plants were grown at ambient or 2X ambient CO2 in unshaded greenhouses for 11 weeks and fertilized daily with nutrient solution either without added P or with 2 mM P in a low-P soil. High P supply reduced AM colonization whereas elevated CO2 counteracted the depressive effect of P on intraradical colonization and vesicle development. Seedlings grown at either elevated CO2, high P or with G. intraradices had greater growth, net assimilation of CO2 (A(CO2)) in leaves, leaf water-use efficiency, leaf dry wt/area, leaf starch and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. Root/whole plant dry wt ratio was decreased by elevated CO2, P, and AM colonization. Mycorrhizal seedlings had higher leaf-P status but lower leaf N and K concentrations than nonmycorrhizal seedlings which was due to growth dilution effects. Starch in fibrous roots was increased by elevated CO2 but reduced by G. intraradices, especially at low-P supply. In fibrous roots, elevated CO2 had no effect on C/N, but AM colonization decreased C/N in both Citrus spp. grown at low-P supply. Overall, there were no species differences in growth or A(CO2). Mycorrhizas did not increase plant growth at ambient CO2. At elevated CO2, however, mycorrhizas stimulated growth at both P levels in sour orange, the more mycorrhiza-dependent species, but only at low-P in sweet orange, the less dependent species. At low-P and elevated CO2, colonization by the AM fungus increased A(CO2) in both species but more so in sour orange than in sweet orange. Leaf P and root N concentrations were increased more and root starch level was decreased less by AM in sour orange than in sweet orange. Thus, the additional CO2 availability to mycorrhizal plants increased CO2 assimilation, growth and nutrient uptake over that of NM plants especially in sour orange under P limitation.},

abstract = {Nitrogen limits primary production in almost every biome on Earth1,2 . Symbiotic nitrogen fixation, conducted by certain angiosperms and their endosymbiotic bacteria, is the largest potential natural source of new nitrogen into the biosphere3 , influencing global primary production, carbon sequestration and element cycling. Because symbiotic nitrogen fixation rep- resents an alternative to soil nitrogen uptake, much of the work on symbiotic nitrogen fixation regulation has focused on soil nitrogen availability4–8 . However, because symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an energetically expensive process9 , light availability to the plant may also regulate symbiotic nitrogen fixation rates 10,11 . Despite the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation to biosphere functioning, the environmental factors that most strongly regulate this process remain unresolved. Here we show that light regulates symbiotic nitrogen fixation more strongly than does soil nitrogen and that light medi- ates the response of symbiotic nitrogen fixation to soil nitro- gen availability. In a shadehouse experiment, low light levels (comparable with forest understories) completely shut down symbiotic nitrogen fixation, whereas soil nitrogen levels that far exceeded plant demand did not fully downregulate symbi- otic nitrogen fixation at high light. For in situ forest seedlings, light was a notable predictor of symbiotic nitrogen fixation activity, but soil-extractable nitrogen was not. Light as a pri- mary regulator of symbiotic nitrogen fixation is a departure from decades of focus on soil nitrogen availability. This shift in our understanding of symbiotic nitrogen fixation regulation can resolve a long-standing biogeochemical paradox 12 , and it will improve our ability to predict how symbiotic nitrogen fixation will fuel the global forest carbon sink and respond to human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle.},

abstract = {Plants buffer increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations through enhanced growth, but the question whether nitrogen availability constrains the magnitude of this ecosystem service remains unresolved. Synthesizing experiments from around the world, we show that CO 2 fertilization is best explained by a simple interaction between nitrogen availability and mycorrhizal association. Plant species that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi show a strong biomass increase (30 ± 3%, P < 0.001) in response to elevated CO 2 regardless of nitrogen availability, whereas low nitrogen availability limits CO 2 fertilization (0 ± 5%, P = 0.946) in plants that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The incorporation of mycorrhizae in global carbon cycle models is feasible, and crucial if we are to accurately project ecosystem responses and feedbacks to climate change.},

abstract = {Land ecosystems sequester on average about a quarter of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. It has been proposed that nitrogen (N) availability will exert an increasingly limiting effect on plants' ability to store additional carbon (C) under rising CO 2 , but these mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we review findings from elevated CO 2 experiments using a plant economics framework, highlighting how ecosystem responses to elevated CO 2 may depend on the costs and benefits of plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and symbiotic N-fixing microbes. We found that N-acquisition efficiency is positively correlated with leaf-level photosynthetic capacity and plant growth, and negatively with soil C storage. Plants that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi and N-fixers may acquire N at a lower cost than plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, the additional growth in ectomycorrhizal plants is partly offset by decreases in soil C pools via priming. Collectively, our results indicate that predictive models aimed at quantifying C cycle feedbacks to global change may be improved by treating N as a resource that can be acquired by plants in exchange for energy, with different costs depending on plant interactions with microbial symbionts.},

abstract = {Soil biota and plant diversity Soil biota, including symbionts such as mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, as well as fungal and bacterial pathogens, affect terrestrial plant diversity and growth patterns (see the Perspective by van der Putten). Teste et al. monitored growth and survival in Australian shrubland plant species paired with soil biota from plants of the same species and from other plants that use different nutrient acquisition strategies. Plant-soil feedbacks appear to drive local plant diversity through interactions between the different types of plants and their associated soil biota. Bennett et al. studied plant-soil feedbacks in soil and seeds from 550 populations of 55 species of North American trees. Feedbacks ranged from positive to negative, depending on the type of mycorrhizal association, and were related to how densely the same species occurred in natural populations. Science, this issue p. 134, p. 173; see also p. 181 Soil biota influence plant performance through plant-soil feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on plant traits and whether plant-soil feedback drives local plant diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring plant species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other plant species. Plant responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different plant responses to soil biota promote local plant diversity. Feedback between plants and soil biota influences diversity in Australian shrublands. Feedback between plants and soil biota influences diversity in Australian shrublands.},

abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can transfer nitrogen (N) to host plants, but the ecological relevance is debated, as total plant N and biomass do not generally increase. The extent to which the symbiosis is mutually beneficial is thought to rely on the stoichiometry of N, phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) availability. While inorganic N fertilization has been shown to elicit strong mutualism, characterized by improved plant and fungal growth and mineral nutrition, similar responses following organic N addition are lacking. Using a compartmented microcosm experiment, we determined the significance to a mycorrhizal plant of placing a 15N-labelled, nitrogen-rich patch of organic matter in a compartment to which only AMF hyphae had access. Control microcosms denied AMF hyphal access to the patch compartment. When permitted access to the patch compartment, the fungus proliferated extensively in the patch and transferred substantial quantities of N to the plant. Moreover, our data demonstrate that allowing hyphal access to an organic matter patch enhanced total plant N and P contents, with a simultaneous and substantial increase in plant biomass. Furthermore, we demonstrate that organic matter fertilization of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants can foster a mutually beneficial symbiosis based on nitrogen transfer, a phenomenon previously thought irrelevant.},

Responses were compared between ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and among fertilizer types, methods of measurement, biomes, and lead investigators. Relationships between degree of response and study length, fertilization rates, total amounts of nutrients applied, and numbers of replicates were also tested. * • Across studies, mycorrhizal abundance decreased 15% under N fertilization and 32% under P fertilization. Elevated CO2 elicited a 47% increase. Nitrogen effects varied significantly among studies, and P effects varied significantly among lead investigators. Most other factors did not affect mycorrhizal responses. * • These results support the plant investment hypothesis, and suggest that global standing stocks of mycorrhizal fungi may increase substantially under elevated CO2 but decline moderately under P additions.

abstract = {A lack of empirical evidence for the microbial regulation of ecosystem processes, including carbon (C) degradation, hinders our ability to develop a framework to directly incorporate the genetic composition of microbial communities in the enzyme-driven Earth system models. Herein we evaluated the linkage between microbial functional genes and extracellular enzyme activity in soil samples collected across three geographical regions of Australia. We found a strong relationship between different functional genes and their corresponding enzyme activities. This relationship was maintained after considering microbial community structure, total C and soil pH using structural equation modelling. Results showed that the variations in the activity of enzymes involved in C degradation were predicted by the functional gene abundance of the soil microbial community (R 2 40.90 in all cases). Our findings provide a strong framework for improved predictions on soil C dynamics that could be achieved by adopting a gene-centric approach incorporating the abundance of functional genes into process models.},

abstract = {Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by rhizobia in legume root nodules injects approximately 40 million tonnes of nitrogen into agricultural systems each year. In exchange for reduced nitrogen from the bacteria, the plant provides rhizobia with reduced carbon and all the essential nutrients required for bacterial metabolism. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation requires exquisite integration of plant and bacterial metabolism. Central to this integration are transporters of both the plant and the rhizobia, which transfer elements and compounds across various plant membranes and the two bacterial membranes. Here we review current knowledge of legume and rhizobial transport and metabolism as they relate to symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Although all legume-rhizobia symbioses have many metabolic features in common, there are also interesting differences between them, which show that evolution has solved metabolic problems in different ways to achieve effective symbiosis in different systems. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright}2013 by Annual Reviews.

abstract = {Background and aims The amount of nitrogen (N) derived from symbiotic N2 fixation by legumes in grasslands might be affected by anthropogenic N and phosphorus (P) inputs, but the underlying mecha- nisms are not known. Methods We evaluated symbiotic N2 fixation in 17 natural and semi-natural grasslands on four continentsthat are subjected to the same full-factorial N and P addition experiment, using the 15N natural abundance method. Results N as well as combined N and P (NP) addi- tion reduced aboveground legume biomass by 65% and 45%, respectively, compared to the control, whereas P addition had no significant impact. Addition of N and/or P had no significant effect on the symbiotic N2 fixation per unit legume biomass. In consequence, the amount of N fixed annually per grassland area was less than half in the N addition treatments compared to control and P addition, irrespective of whether the dominant legumes were annuals or perennials. Conclusion Our results reveal that N addition mainly impacts symbiotic N2 fixation via reduced biomass of legumes rather than changes in N 2 fixation per unit legume biomass. The results show that soil N enrichment by anthropogenic activities significantly reduces N2 fixation in grasslands, and these effects cannot be reversed by additional P amendment.},

abstract = {A global assessment of precipitation chemistry and deposition has been carried out under the direction of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Scientific Advisory Group for Precipitation Chemistry (SAG-PC). The assessment addressed three questions: (1) what do measurements and model estimates of precipitation chemistry and wet, dry and total deposition of sulfur, nitrogen, sea salt, base cations, organic acids, acidity, and phosphorus show globally and regionally? (2) has the wet deposition of major ions changed since 2000 (and, where information and data are available, since 1990) and (3) what are the major gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge? To that end, regionally-representative measurements for two 3-year-averaging periods, 2000-2002 and 2005-2007, were compiled worldwide. Data from the 2000-2002 averaging period were combined with 2001 ensemble-mean modeling results from 21 global chemical transport models produced in Phase 1 of the Coordinated Model Studies Activities of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP). The measurement data and modeling results were used to generate global and regional maps of major ion concentrations in precipitation and deposition. A major product of the assessment is a database of quality assured ion concentration and wet deposition data gathered from regional and national monitoring networks. The database is available for download from the World Data Centre for Precipitation Chemistry (http://wdcpc.org/). The assessment concludes that global concentrations and deposition of sulfur and nitrogen are reasonably well characterized with levels generally highest near emission sources and more than an order of magnitude lower in areas largely free of anthropogenic influences. In many parts of the world, wet deposition of reduced nitrogen exceeds that of oxidized nitrogen and is increasing. Sulfur and nitrogen concentrations and deposition in North America and Europe have declined significantly in line with emission reduction policies. Major regions of the world, including South America, the more remote areas of North America, much of Asia, Africa, Oceania, polar regions, and all of the oceans, are inadequately sampled for all of the major ions in wet and dry deposition, and particularly so for phosphorus, organic forms of nitrogen, and weak acids including carbonates and organic acids. Measurement-based inferential estimates of dry deposition are limited to sulfur and some nitrogen in only a few regions of the world and methods are highly uncertain. The assessment concludes with recommendations to address major gaps and uncertainties in global ion concentration and deposition measurements. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Mechanistic photosynthesis models are at the heart of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) simulating the daily, monthly, annual and decadal rhythms of carbon assimilation (A). These models are founded on robust mathematical hypotheses that describe howA responds to changes in light and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Two predominant pho- tosynthesis models are in common usage: Farquhar (FvCB) and Collatz (CBGB). However, a detailed quantitative comparison of these two models has never been undertaken. In this study, we unify the FvCB and CBGB models to a common parameter set and use novel multi-hypothesis methods (that account for both hypothesis and parameter vari- ability) for process-level sensitivity analysis. These models represent three key biological processes: carboxylation, electron transport, triose phosphate use (TPU) and an addi- tional model process: limiting-rate selection. Each of the four processes comprises 1–3 alternative hypotheses giving 12 possible individual models with a total of 14 parameters. To broaden inference, TBM simulations were run and novel, high-resolution photosynthe- sis measurements were made. We show that parameters associated with carboxylation are the most influential parameters but also reveal the surprising and marked dominance of the limiting-rate selection process (accounting for 57% of the variation in A vs. 22% for carboxylation). The limiting-rate selection assumption proposed by CBGB smooths the transition between limiting rates and always reduces A below the minimum of all poten- tially limiting rates, by up to 25%, effectively imposing a fourth limitation onA. Evaluation of the CBGB smoothing function in three TBMs demonstrated a reduction in globalA by 4%–10%, equivalent to 50%–160% of current annual fossil fuel emissions. This analysis reveals a surprising and previously unquantified influence of a process that has been in- tegral to many TBMs for decades, highlighting the value of multi-hypothesis methods},

abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and global mean temperature are expected to be significantly higher by the end of the 21st century. Elevated CO2 (eCO2) and higher temperature each affect plant physiology and growth, but their interactive effects have not been reviewed statistically with respect to higher chronic mean temperatures and abrupt heat stress. In this meta-analysis, we examined the effect of CO2 on the physiology and growth of plants subjected to different temperature treatments. The CO2 treatments were categorized into ambient (<400 ppm) or elevated (>560 ppm) levels, while temperature treatments were categorized into ambient temperature (AT), elevated temperature (ET; AT + 1.4–6°C), or heat stress (HS; AT + >8°C). Plant species were grouped according to photosynthetic pathways (C3, C4), functional types (legumes, non-legumes), growth forms (herbaceous, woody), and economic purposes (crop, non-crop). eCO2 enhanced net photosynthesis at AT, ET, and HS in C3 species (especially at the HS level), but in C4 species, it had no effect at AT, a positive effect at ET, and a negative effect at HS. The positive effect of eCO2 on net photosynthesis was greater for legumes than for non-legumes at HS, for non-crops than crops at ET, and for woody than herbaceous species at ET and HS. Total (W T) and above- (W AG) and below-ground (W BG) biomass were increased by eCO2 for most species groups at all temperatures, except for C4 species and W BG of legumes at HS. Hence, eCO2 × heat effects on growth were often not explained by effects on net photosynthesis. Overall, the results show that eCO2 effects on plant physiology and growth vary under different temperature regimes, among functional groups and photosynthetic pathways, and among response variables. These findings have important implications for biomass accumulation and ecosystem functioning in the future when the CO2 level is higher and climate extremes, such as heat waves, become more frequent.},

abstract = {Climate changes and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment widely threaten plant diversity and ecosystem functions. Understanding the mechanisms governing plant species turnover across nutrient gradients is crucial to developing successful management and restoration strategies. We tested whether and how soil microbes, particularly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), could mediate plant community response to a 15 years long-term N (0, 4, 8, and 16 g N m−2 year−1) and P (0 and 8 g N m−2 year−1) enrichment in a grassland system. We found N and P enrichment resulted in plant community diversity decrease and composition change, in which perennial C4 graminoids were dramatically reduced while annuals and perennial forbs increased. Metabarcoding analysis of soil fungal community showed that N and P changed fungal diversity and composition, of which only a cluster of AMF identified by the co-occurrence networks analysis was highly sensitive to P treatments and was negatively correlated with shifts in percentage cover of perennial C4 graminoids. Moreover, by estimating the mycorrhizal responsiveness (MR) of 41 plant species in the field experiment from 264 independent tests, we found that the community weighted mean MR of the plant community was substantially reduced with nutrient enrichment and was positively correlated with C4 graminoids percentage cover. Both analyses of covariance and structural equation modeling indicated that the shift in MR rather than AMF composition change was the primary predictor of the decline in perennial C4 graminoids, suggesting that the energy cost invested by C4 plants on those sensitive AMF might drive the inferior competitive abilities compared with other groups. Our results suggest that shifts in the competitive ability of mycorrhizal responsive plants can drive plant community change to anthropogenic eutrophication, suggesting a functional benefit of mycorrhizal mutualism in ecological restoration following climatic or anthropogenic degradation of soil communities.},

abstract = {The worldwide leaf economics spectrum relates leaf lifespan (LL) to leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA)1. By combining three well-supported principles2–4, we show that an isometric relationship between these two quantities maximizes the leaf's net carbon gain. This theory predicts a spectrum of equally competent LMA-LL combinations in any given environment, and how their optimal ratio varies across environments. By analysing two large, independent leaf-trait datasets for woody species1,5, we provide quantitative empirical support for the predicted dependencies of LL on LMA and environment in evergreen plants, and for the distinct predicted dependencies of LMA on light, temperature, growing-season length and aridity in evergreen and deciduous plants. We thereby resolve the long-standing question of why deciduous LMA tends to increase (with increasing LL) towards the equator, while evergreen LMA and LL decrease6. We also show how the statistical distribution of LMA within communities can be modelled as an outcome of environmental selection on the global pool of species with diverse values of LMA and LL.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Gross primary production (GPP) - the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) by leaves, and its conversion to sugars by photosynthesis - is the basis for life on land. Earth System Models (ESMs) incorporating the interactions of land ecosystems and climate are used to predict the future of the terrestrial sink for anthropogenic CO21 . ESMs require accurate representation of GPP. However, current ESMs disagree on how GPP responds to environmental variations 1,2, suggesting a need for a more robust theoretical framework for modelling 3,4 . Here, we focus on a key quantity for GPP, the ratio of leaf internal to external CO2 ($\chi$). $\chi$ is tightly regulated and depends on environmental conditions, but is represented empirically and incompletely in today's models. We show that a simple evolutionary optimality hypothesis 5,6 predicts specific quantitative dependencies of $\chi$ on temperature, vapour pressure deficit and elevation; and that these same dependencies emerge from an independent analysis of empirical $\chi$ values, derived from a worldwide dataset of >3,500 leaf stable carbon isotope measurements. A single global equation embodying these relationships then unifies the empirical light-use efficiency model 7 with the standard model of C3 photosynthesis 8, and successfully predicts GPP measured at eddy-covariance flux sites. This success is notable given the equation's simplicity and broad applicability across biomes and plant functional types. It provides a theoretical underpinning for the analysis of plant functional coordination across species and emergent properties of ecosystems, and a potential basis for the reformulation of the controls of GPP in next-generation ESMs.},

abstract = {Purpose: Impacts of dryness stress (i.e., low soil moisture [SM] and high vapor pressure deficit [VPD]) on gross primary production (GPP) have received considerable attention in recent years, however, their biological mechanism still needs to be elucidated. Methods: We decomposed GPP into canopy stomatal conductance (gs), ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (Ci/Ca), and species composition and investigated the interaction of dryness stress, gs, Ci/Ca, and relative abundance of C4 plants (C4/(C3 + C4)) to determine how they regulate GPP along an aridity gradient in Inner Mongolia Plateau. We used biomass-weighted leaf carbon ($\delta$13C) and oxygen ($\delta$18O) isotopes to calculate canopy Ci/Ca and 18O enrichment in leaf tissue above source water (△18O), respectively. Results: A positive relationship between 1/△18O and canopy gs demonstrated that 1/△18O was a reliable indicator for canopy gs. Soil moisture (SM) exhibited a positive effect on 1/△18O and Ci/Ca, while Ci/Ca decreased and C4/(C3 + C4) increased with increasing water vapor pressure (VPD). 1/△18O and C4/(C3 + C4) indirectly regulated GPP via Ci/Ca, and the effect of C4/(C3 + C4) on the variability in Ci/Ca was stronger than that of 1/△18O. Interaction between dryness stressors (SM and VPD) and vegetation properties (1/△18O, Ci/Ca, and C4/(C3 + C4)) captured 74.6% of the variability in GPP, indicating that spatial variability in GPP was determined overwhelmingly by indirect effects of dryness on biological processes. Conclusions: Increasing relative abundance of C4 plants would effectively mitigate the negative effects of dryness stress on GPP.},

abstract = {Adding nutrients to nutrient-limited ecosystems typically lowers plant diversity and decreases species asynchrony. Both, in turn, decrease the stability of productivity in the response to negative climate fluctuations such as droughts. However, most classic studies examining stability have been done in relatively wet grasslands dominated by perennial grasses. We examined how nutrient additions influence the stability of productivity to rainfall variability in an arid grassland with a mix of perennial and annual species. Of the nutrients, only nitrogen increased productivity, and only in wet years. In addition, only nitrogen decreased the stability of productivity. Thus, nutrient addition makes ecosystem productivity less stable in both wet and arid grasslands. However, the mechanism is very different. In contrast to wet grasslands, adding nitrogen to an arid grassland did not decrease diversity. Rather, stability decreased with nitrogen addition due to an increase in annual species that increased productivity. In other words, in our arid grassland, nitrogen addition decreased ecosystem stability because of increased ecosystem responsiveness to positive climate fluctuations. These climate fluctuations were facilitated by annual species that take advantage of wet years and can escape dry years as seeds. Our data support the conclusion that nutrient additions decrease the stability of productivity in both wet and arid grasslands. Nutrient enrichment increases the sensitivity of productivity to low rainfall years in wet grasslands, whereas nutrient enrichment in arid grasslands increases the sensitivity of productivity to high rainfall years.},

abstract = {Despite decades of research, how climate warming alters the global flux of soil respiration is still poorly characterized. Here, we use meta-analysis to synthesize 202 soil respiration datasets from 50 ecosystem warming experiments across multiple terrestrial ecosystems. We found that, on average, warming by 2 °C increased soil respiration by 12% during the early warming years, but warming-induced drought partially offset this effect. More significantly, the two components of soil respiration, heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration showed distinct responses. The warming effect on autotrophic respiration was not statistically detectable during the early warming years, but nonetheless decreased with treatment duration. In contrast, warming by 2 °C increased heterotrophic respiration by an average of 21%, and this stimulation remained stable over the warming duration. This result challenged the assumption that microbial activity would acclimate to the rising temperature. Together, our findings demonstrate that distinguishing heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration would allow us better understand and predict the long-term response of soil respiration to warming. The dependence of soil respiration on soil moisture condition also underscores the importance of incorporating warming-induced soil hydrological changes when modeling soil respiration under climate change.},

abstract = {The concept of a root economics space (RES) is increasingly adopted to explore root trait variation and belowground resource-acquisition strategies. Much progress has been made on interactions of root morphology and mycorrhizal symbioses. However, root exudation, with a significant carbon (C) cost (c. 5–21% of total photosynthetically fixed C) to enhance resource acquisition, remains a missing link in this RES. Here, we argue that incorporating root exudation into the structure of RES is key to a holistic understanding of soil nutrient acquisition. We highlight the different functional roles of root exudates in soil phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) acquisition. Thereafter, we synthesize emerging evidence that illustrates how root exudation interacts with root morphology and mycorrhizal symbioses at the level of species and individual plant and argue contrasting patterns in species evolved in P-impoverished vs N-limited environments. Finally, we propose a new conceptual framework, integrating three groups of root functional traits to better capture the complexity of belowground resource-acquisition strategies. Such a deeper understanding of the integrated and dynamic interactions of root morphology, root exudation, and mycorrhizal symbioses will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying species coexistence and how to explore belowground interactions for sustainable managed systems.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature documents the press- ing need to develop soil biogeochemistry models that more accurately reflect contemporary understanding of soil pro- cesses and better capture soil carbon (C) responses to en- vironmental perturbations. Models that explicitly represent microbial activity offer inroads to improve representations of soil biogeochemical processes, but have yet to consider relationships between litter quality, functional differences in microbial physiology, and the physical protection of micro- bial byproducts in forming stable soil organic matter (SOM). To address these limitations, we introduce the MIcrobial- MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model, and evalu- ate it by comparing site-level soil C projections with obser- vations from a long-term litter decomposition study and soil warming experiment. In MIMICS, the turnover of litter and SOM pools is governed by temperature-sensitive Michaelis– Menten kinetics and the activity of two physiologically dis- tinct microbial functional types. The production of micro- bial residues through microbial turnover provides inputs to SOM pools that are considered physically or chemically pro- tected. Soil clay content determines the physical protection of SOM in different soil environments. MIMICS adequately simulates the mean rate of leaf litter decomposition observed at temperate and boreal forest sites, and captures observed effects of litter quality on decomposition rates. Moreover, MIMICS better captures the response of SOM pools to exper- imental warming, with rapid SOM losses but declining tem- perature sensitivity to long-term warming, compared with a more conventional model structure. MIMICS incorporates current microbial theory to explore the mechanisms by which litter C is converted to stable SOM, and to improve predic- tions of soil C responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {Understanding future changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle is important for reliable projections of climate change and impacts on ecosystems. It is well known that nitrogen (N) could limit plants' response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and it is therefore important to include a representation of the N cycle in Earth system models. Here we present the implementation of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES)-the land surface scheme of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM). Two configurations are discussed-the first one (JULES-CN) has a bulk soil biogeochemical model and the second one is a development configuration that resolves the soil biogeochemistry with depth (JULES-CNlayer). In JULES the nitrogen (N) cycle is based on the existing carbon (C) cycle and represents all the key terrestrial N processes in a parsimonious way. Biological N fixation is dependent on net primary productivity, and N deposition is specified as an external input. Nitrogen leaves the vegetation and soil system via leaching and a bulk gas loss term. Nutrient limitation reduces carbon-use efficiency (CUE-ratio of net to gross primary productivity) and can slow soil decomposition. We show that ecosystem level N limitation of net primary productivity (quantified in the model by the ratio of the potential amount of C that can be allocated to growth and spreading of the vegetation compared with the actual amount achieved in its natural state) falls at the lower end of the observational estimates in forests (approximately 1.0 in the model compared with 1.01 to 1.38 in the observations). The model shows more N limitation in the tropical savanna and tundra biomes, consistent with the available observations. Simulated C and N pools and fluxes are comparable to the limited available observations and model-derived estimates. The introduction of an N cycle improves the representation of interannual variability of global net ecosystem exchange, which was more pronounced in the C-cycle-only versions of JULES (JULES-C) than shown in estimates from the Global Carbon Project. It also reduces the present-day CUE from a global mean value of 0.45 for JULES-C to 0.41 for JULES-CN and 0.40 for JULES-CNlayer, all of which fall within the observational range. The N cycle also alters the response of the C fluxes over the 20th century and limits the CO2 fertilisation effect, such that the simulated current-day land C sink is reduced by about 0.5 Pg C yr-1 compared to the version with no N limitation. JULES-CNlayer additionally improves the representation of soil biogeochemistry, includ ing turnover times in the northern high latitudes. The inclu sion of a prognostic land N scheme marks a step forward in functionality and realism for the JULES and UKESM mod els.},

abstract = {High tissue nitrogen (N) concentrations in N-fixing legumes may be driven by an evolutionary commitment to a high N strategy, by higher N availability from fixation, or by some other cause. To disentangle these hypotheses, we asked two questions: are legumes hardwired to have high N concentrations? Aside from delivering fixed N, how does inoculation affect legume N concentrations? In order to understand drivers of plant stoichiometry, we subjected four herbaceous legume species to nine levels of N fertilization in a glasshouse. Half of the individuals were inoculated with crushed nodules, whereas the other half remained uninoculated and could not fix N. Across four legume species, we found that tissue stoichiometry and nutrient content were more plastic than has been described for any other plant species. In addition, inoculated plants had higher tissue N concentrations than N fixation activity alone can explain. Rather than being hardwired for high N or phosphorus (P) demand, the legumes we examined were highly flexible in their nutrient allocation. Understanding the drivers of legume N concentrations is essential to understanding the role of N fixers in community- and ecosystem-level processes.},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate},

abstract = {Global mean temperature is predicted to increase by 2–7 °C and precipitation to change across the globe by the end of this century. To quantify climate effects on ecosystem processes, a number of climate change experiments have been established around the world in various ecosystems. Despite these efforts, general responses of terrestrial ecosystems to changes in temperature and precipitation, and especially to their combined effects, remain unclear. We used meta‐analysis to synthesize ecosystem‐level responses to warming, altered precipitation, and their combination. We focused on plant growth and ecosystem carbon (C) balance, including biomass, net primary production (NPP), respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and ecosystem photosynthesis, synthesizing results from 85 studies. We found that experimental warming and increased precipitation generally stimulated plant growth and ecosystem C fluxes, whereas decreased precipitation had the opposite effects. For example, warming significantly stimulated total NPP, increased ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration. Experimentally reduced precipitation suppressed aboveground NPP (ANPP) and NEE, whereas supplemental precipitation enhanced ANPP and NEE. Plant productivity and ecosystem C fluxes generally showed higher sensitivities to increased precipitation than to decreased precipitation. Interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation tended to be smaller than expected from additive, single‐factor effects, though low statistical power limits the strength of these conclusions. New experiments with combined temperature and precipitation manipulations are needed to conclusively determine the importance of temperature–precipitation interactions on the C balance of terrestrial ecosystems under future climate conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract. Continual input of reactive nitrogen (N) is required to support the natural turnover of N in terrestrial ecosystems. This N demand can be satisfied in various ways, including biological N fixation (BNF) (the dominant pathway under natural conditions), lightning-induced abiotic N fixation, N uptake from sedimentary substrates, and N deposition from natural and anthropogenic sources. We estimated the global new N fixation demand (NNF), i.e. the total new N input required to sustain net primary production (NPP) in non-agricultural terrestrial ecosystems regardless of its origin, using a N-enabled global dynamic vegetation model (DyN-LPJ). DyN-LPJ does not explicitly simulate BNF; rather, it estimates total NNF using a mass balance criterion and assumes that this demand is met from one source or another. The model was run in steady state and then in transient mode driven by recent changes in CO2 concentration and climate. A range of values for key stoichiometric parameters was considered, based on recently published analyses. Modelled NPP and C : N ratios of litter and soil organic matter were consistent with independent estimates. Modelled geographic patterns of ecosystem NNF were similar to other analyses, but actual estimated values exceeded recent estimates of global BNF. The results were sensitive to a few key parameters: the fraction of litter carbon respired to CO2 during decomposition and plant-type-specific C : N ratios of litter and soil. The modelled annual NNF increased by about 15 % during the course of the transient run, mainly due to increasing CO2 concentration. The model did not overestimate recent terrestrial carbon uptake, suggesting that the increase in NNF demand has so far been met. Rising CO2 is further increasing the NNF demand, while the future capacity of N sources to support this is unknown.},

abstract = {Close coupling between water loss and carbon dioxide uptake requires coordination of plant hydraulics and photosynthesis. However, there is still limited information on the quantitative relationships between hydraulic and photosynthetic traits. We propose a basis for these relationships based on optimality theory, and test its predictions by analysis of measurements on 107 species from 11 sites, distributed along a nearly 3000-m elevation gradient. Hydraulic and leaf economic traits were less plastic, and more closely associated with phylogeny, than photosynthetic traits. The two sets of traits were linked by the sapwood to leaf area ratio (Huber value, vH). The observed coordination between vH and sapwood hydraulic conductivity (KS) and photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax) conformed to the proposed quantitative theory. Substantial hydraulic diversity was related to the trade-off between KS and vH. Leaf drought tolerance (inferred from turgor loss point, –$\Psi$tlp) increased with wood density, but the trade-off between hydraulic efficiency (KS) and –$\Psi$tlp was weak. Plant trait effects on vH were dominated by variation in KS, while effects of environment were dominated by variation in temperature. This research unifies hydraulics, photosynthesis and the leaf economics spectrum in a common theoretical framework, and suggests a route towards the integration of photosynthesis and hydraulics in land-surface models.},

abstract = {Evidence supporting water limitation in arid-semiarid ecosystems includes strong correlations between aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and annual precipitation as well as results from experimental water additions. Similarly, there is evidence of N limitation on ANPP in low precipitation ecosystems, but is this a widespread phenomenon? Are all arid-semiarid ecosystems equally limited by nitrogen? Is the response of N fertilization modulated by water availability? We conducted a meta-analysis of ANPP responses to N fertilization across arid to subhumid ecosystems to quantify N limitation, using the effect-size index R which is the ratio of ANPP in fertilized to control plots. Nitrogen addition increased ANPP across all studies by an average of 50%, and nitrogen effects increased significantly (P = 0.03) along the 50-650 mm yr-1 precipitation gradient. The response ratio decreased with mean annual temperature in arid and semiarid ecosystems but was insensitive in subhumid systems. Sown pastures showed significant (P = 0.007) higher responses than natural ecosystems. Neither plant-life form nor chemical form of the applied fertilizer showed significant effects on the primary production response to N addition. Our results showed that nitrogen limitation is a widespread phenomenon in low-precipitation ecosystems and that its importance increases with annual precipitation from arid to subhumid regions. Both water and N availability limit primary production, probably at different times during the year; with frequency of N limitation increasing and frequency of water limitation decreasing as annual precipitation increases. Expected increase N deposition, which could be significant even in arid ecosystems, would increase aboveground net primary production in water-limited ecosystems that account for 40% of the terrestrial surface. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We did so by conducting a meta-analysis and found that soil nutrients responded differentially to drivers of climate change depending on the approach considered. Soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations generally decreased with water addition in manipulative experiments but increased with annual precipitation along environmental gradients. Different patterns were also observed between warming experiments and temperature gradients. Our findings provide evidence of inconsistent results and suggest that manipulative experiments may be better predictors of the causal impacts of short-term (months to years) climate change on soil nutrients but environmental gradients may provide better information for long-term correlations (centuries to millennia) between these nutrients and climatic features. Ecosystem models should consequently incorporate both experimental and observational data to properly assess the impacts of climate change on nutrient cycling.},

abstract = {Against a backdrop of rising temperature, large portions of the western United States are experiencing fewer, larger and less frequent precipitation events. How such temporal ‘repackaging' of precipitation alters the magnitude and timing of seasonal maximum gross primary productivity (GPPmax) remains unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap is critical, since changes to GPPmax magnitude and timing can impact a range of ecosystem services and management decisions. Here we used a field-based precipitation manipulation experiment in a semi-arid mixed annual/perennial bunchgrass ecosystem with mean annual precipitation $\sim$384 mm to investigate how temporal repackaging of a fixed total seasonal precipitation amount impacts seasonal GPPmax and its timing. We found that temporal repackaging of precipitation profoundly influenced the seasonal timing of GPPmax. Many/small precipitation events advanced the seasonal timing of GPPmax by $\sim$13 days in comparison with climatic normal precipitation. Conversely, few/large events led to deeper soil water infiltration, which delayed the timing of GPPmax by up to 16 days in comparison with climatic normal precipitation, and altered end-of-season community composition by increasing the diversity of shallow-rooted annual plants. While GPPmax magnitude did not differ across precipitation treatments, it was positively correlated with the abundance and biomass of deeper-rooted perennial bunchgrasses. The sensitivity of plant growth, biomass accumulation and plant life histories to the timing and magnitude of precipitation events and the resulting temporal patterns of soil moisture regulated ecosystem responses to altered precipitation patterns. Our results highlight the sensitivity of semi-arid grassland ecosystem to the temporal repackaging of precipitation. We find that already-observed and model-forecasted shifts toward few/large precipitation events could drive significant delays in the timing of peak productivity for this ecosystem. Adaptive land management frameworks should consider these findings since shifts in peak ecosystem productivity would have major implications for multiple land user communities. Additional research is needed to better understand the role of climate, community composition and soil properties in mediating variability in the seasonal timing of maximum ecosystem productivity.

We simulate nitrogen deposition over the US in 2006–2008 by using the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model at 1/2°×2/3° horizontal resolution over North America and adjacent oceans. US emissions of NOx and NH3 in the model are 6.7 and 2.9 Tg N a−1 respectively, including a 20% natural contribution for each. Ammonia emissions are a factor of 3 lower in winter than summer, providing a good match to US network observations of NHx (≡NH3 gas + ammonium aerosol) and ammonium wet deposition fluxes. Model comparisons to observed deposition fluxes and surface air concentrations of oxidized nitrogen species (NOy) show overall good agreement but excessive wintertime HNO3 production over the US Midwest and Northeast. This suggests a model overestimate N2O5 hydrolysis in aerosols, and a possible factor is inhibition by aerosol nitrate. Model results indicate a total nitrogen deposition flux of 6.5 Tg N a−1 over the contiguous US, including 4.2 as NOy and 2.3 as NHx. Domestic anthropogenic, foreign anthropogenic, and natural sources contribute respectively 78%, 6%, and 16% of total nitrogen deposition over the contiguous US in the model.

abstract = {A variety of spatially continuous rainfall products are available but little evaluation of their accuracy has been published for areas with high spatial variability in rainfall. Five gridded rainfall products (PRISM, RTMA, and the interpolated Florida Automated Weather Network, FAWN, rainfall layers based on three interpolated methods) were assessed for Florida State. Point-to-pixel and pixel-to-pixel comparisons were performed to compare the five products. On average, the PRISM and RTMA products resulted in a better fit with the daily FAWN rainfall datasets, while FAWN-based interpolated products resulted in a better fit with the monthly FAWN rainfall datasets based on point-to-pixel analysis. Inverse distance weighting and ordinary kriging methods performed slightly better than the thin plate spline method in predicting daily rainfall. In general, monthly and seasonal rainfall amounts from PRISM and RTMA products were higher and lower, respectively, than reference rainfall amounts from FAWN gauge stations and FAWN-based interpolated products.},

abstract = {The simultaneous symbiosis of leguminous plants with two root mutualists, endophytic fungi and rhizobia is common in nature, yet how two mutualists interact and coexist before infecting plants and the concomitant effects on nodulation are less understood. Using a combination of metabolic analysis, fungal deletion mutants and comparative transcriptomics, we demonstrated that Bradyrhizobium and a facultatively biotrophic fungus, Phomopsis liquidambaris, interacted to stimulate fungal flavonoid production, and thereby primed Bradyrhizobial nodulation signaling, enhancing Bradyrhizobial responses to root exudates and leading to early nodulation of peanut (Arachis hypogaea), and such effects were compromised when disturbing fungal flavonoid biosynthesis. Stress sensitivity assays and reactive oxygen species (ROS) determination revealed that flavonoid production acted as a strategy to alleviate hyphal oxidative stress during Ph. liquidambaris- Bradyrhizobial interactions. By investigating the interactions between Ph. liquidambaris and a collection of 38 rhizobacteria, from distinct bacterial genera, we additionally showed that the flavonoid- ROS module contributed to the maintenance of fungal and bacterial coexistence, and fungal niche colonization under soil conditions. Our results demonstrate for the first time that rhizobial nodulation signaling can be primed by fungi before symbiosis with host plants and highlight the importance of flavonoid in tripartite interactions between legumes, beneficial fungi and rhizobia.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for nutrient uptake and growth in rice has been widely recognized. However, little is known about the distribution of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in rice under AMF inoculation, which can affect grain yield and quality. This study was conducted to investigate the distribution of C and N within rice plants under AMF inoculation and the effects on grain yield and quality. RESULTS: AMF inoculation significantly increased N accumulation and distribution in vegetative tissues at tillering, and N translocation into seeds from heading to maturity. Consequently, AMF inoculation more strongly impacted the distribution of N than that of C in seeds, with significantly reduced C:N ratios and increased protein content (by 7.4\%). Additionally, AMF inoculation significantly increased grain yield by 28.2\% through increasing the grain:straw ratio by 18.4\%. In addition, the roots of inoculated rice exhibited greater change in C distribution, with significantly higher C concentrations, C accumulations, and C:N ratios at tillering and maturity. CONCLUSION: AMF inoculation affected the distribution of N in seeds and C in roots. As such, AMF inoculation may be a potential method for improving grain yield and quality. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract = {As the second largest carbon (C) flux between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems, soil respiration (Rs) plays vital roles in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2 ]) and climatic dynamics in the earth system. Although numerous manipulative studies and a few meta-analyses have been conducted to determine the responses of Rs and its two components [i.e., autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) respiration] to single global change factors, the interactive effects of the multiple factors are still unclear. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of 150 multiple-factor (≥2) studies to examine the main and interactive effects of global change factors on Rs and its two components. Our results showed that elevated [CO2 ] (E), nitrogen addition (N), irrigation (I), and warming (W) induced significant increases in Rs by 28.6\%, 8.8\%, 9.7\%, and 7.1\%, respectively. The combined effects of the multiple factors, EN, EW, DE, IE, IN, IW, IEW, and DEW, were also significantly positive on Rs to a greater extent than those of the single-factor ones. For all the individual studies, the additive interactions were predominant on Rs (90.6\%) and its components (≈70.0\%) relative to synergistic and antagonistic ones. However, the different combinations of global change factors (e.g., EN, NW, EW, IW) indicated that the three types of interactions were all important, with two combinations for synergistic effects, two for antagonistic, and five for additive when at least eight independent experiments were considered. In addition, the interactions of elevated [CO2 ] and warming had opposite effects on Ra and Rh, suggesting that different processes may influence their responses to the multifactor interactions. Our study highlights the crucial importance of the interactive effects among the multiple factors on Rs and its components, which could inform regional and global models to assess the climate-biosphere feedbacks and improve predictions of the future states of the ecological and climate systems.},

abstract = {Biodiversity on the Earth is changing at an unprecedented rate due to a variety of global change factors (GCFs). However, the effects of GCFs on microbial diversity is unclear despite that soil microorganisms play a critical role in biogeochemical cycling. Here, we synthesize 1235 GCF observations worldwide and show that microbial rare species are more sensitive to GCFs than common species, while GCFs do not always lead to a reduction in microbial diversity. GCFs-induced shifts in microbial alpha diversity can be predominately explained by the changed soil pH. In addition, GCF impacts on soil functionality are explained by microbial community structure and biomass rather than the alpha diversity. Altogether, our findings of GCF impacts on microbial diversity are fundamentally different from previous knowledge for well-studied plant and animal communities, and are crucial to policy-making for the con- servation of microbial diversity hotspots under global changes.},

abstract = {Over the past several decades, the land modeling community has recognized the importance of nutrient regulation on the global terrestrial carbon cycle. Implementations of nutrient limitation in land models are diverse, varying from applying simple empirical down-regulation of potential gross primary productivity under nutrient deficit conditions to more mechanistic treatments. In this study, we introduce a new approach to model multinutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) limitations in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model version 1 (ELMv1-ECA). The development is grounded on (1) advances in representing multiple-consumer, multiple-nutrient competition; (2) a generic dynamic allocation scheme based on water, N, P, and light availability; (3) flexible plant CNP stoichiometry; (4) prognostic treatment of N and P constraints on several carbon cycle processes; and (5) global data sets of plant physiological traits. Through benchmarking the model against best knowledge of global plant and soil carbon pools and fluxes, we show that our implementation of nutrient constraints on the present-day carbon cycle is robust at the global scale. Compared with predecessor versions, ELMv1-ECA better predicts global-scale gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, leaf area index, vegetation biomass, soil carbon stocks, evapotranspiration, N2O emissions, and NO3- leaching. Factorial experiments indicate that representing the phosphorus cycle improves modeled carbon fluxes, while considering dynamic allocation improves modeled carbon stock density. We also highlight the value of using the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) package to evaluate and document performance during model development.},

abstract = {Effects of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis on plant growth, carbon (C) and ni- trogen (N) accumulation, and partitioning was investigated in Triticum aestivum L. plants grown under elevated CO2 in a pot experiment. Wheat plants inoculated or not inoculated with the AM fungus were grown in two glasshouse cells with dif- ferent CO2 concentrations (400 and 700 ppm) for 10 weeks. A 15 N isotope labeling technique was used to trace plant N up- take. Results showed that elevated CO2 increased AM fungal colonization. Under CO2 elevation, AM plants had higher C concentration and higher plant biomass than the non-AM plants. CO2 elevation did not affect C and N partitioning in plant organs, while AM symbiosis increased C and N alloca- tion into the roots. In addition, plant C and N accumulation, 15 N recovery rate, and N use efficiency (NUE) were signifi- cantly higher in AM plants than in non-AM controls under CO2 enrichment. It is concluded that AM symbiosis favors C and N partitioning in roots, increases C accumulation and N uptake, and leads to greater NUE in wheat plants grown at elevated CO2},

abstract = {Differences in photosynthetic capacity among tree species and tree functional types are currently assumed to be largely driven by variation in leaf nutrient content, particularly nitrogen (N). However, recent studies indicate that leaf N content is often a poor predictor of variation in photosynthetic capacity in tropical trees. In this study, we explored the relative importance of area-based total leaf N content (Ntot) and within-leaf N allocation to photosynthetic capacity versus light-harvesting in controlling the variation in photosynthetic capacity (i.e. Vcmax, Jmax) among mature trees of 12 species belonging to either early (ES) or late successional (LS) groups growing in a tropical montane rainforest in Rwanda, Central Africa. Photosynthetic capacity at a common leaf temperature of 25˚C (i.e. maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation, Vcmax25 and of electron transport, Jmax25) was higher in ES than in LS species (+ 58% and 68% for Vcmax25 and Jmax25, respectively). While Ntot did not significantly differ between successional groups, the photosynthetic dependency on Ntot was markedly different. In ES species, Vcmax25 was strongly and positively related to Ntot but this was not the case in LS species. However, there was no significant trade-off between relative leaf N investments in compounds maximizing photosynthetic capacity versus compounds maximizing light harvesting. Both leaf dark respiration at 25˚C (+ 33%) and, more surprisingly, apparent photosynthetic quantum yield (+ 35%) was higher in ES than in LS species. Moreover, Rd25 was positively related to Ntot for both ES and LS species. Our results imply that efforts to quantify carbon fluxes of tropical montane rainforests would be improved if they considered contrasting within-leaf N allocation and photosynthetic Ntot dependencies between species with different successional strategies.},

abstract = {Feedbacks between the terrestrial carbon cycle and the atmosphere have the potential to greatly modify expected rates of future climate change. This makes it all the more urgent to exploit all existing data for the purpose of accurate modelling of the underlying processes. Here we use a Bayesian random sampling method to constrain parameters of the Farquhar model of leaf photosynthesis and a model of leaf respiration against a comprehensive set of plant trait data at the leaf level. The resulting probability density function (PDF) of model parameters is contrasted with a PDF derived using a conventional “expert knowledge” approach. When running the Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology (BETHY) scheme with a 1000‐ member sub‐sample of each of the two PDFs for present climate and a climate scenario, we find that the use of plant trait data is able to reduce the uncertainty range of simulated net leaf assimilation (NLA) by more than a factor of two. Most of the remaining variability is caused by only four parameters, associated with the acclimation of photosynthesis to plant growth temperature and to how leaf stomata react to atmospheric CO 2 concentration. We suggest that this method should be used extensively to parameterize Earth system models, given that data bases on plant traits are increasingly being made available to the modelling community.},

abstract = {Background: Cryptogamic vegetation dominates the ice-free areas along the Antarctic Peninsula. The two mosses Sanionia uncinata and Polytrichastrum alpinum inhabit soils with contrasting water availability. Sanionia uncinata grows in soil with continuous water supply, while P. alpinum grows in sandy, non-flooded soils. Desiccation and rehydration experiments were carried out to test for differences in the rate of water loss and uptake, with non-structural carbohydrates analysed to test their role in these processes. Results: Individual plants of S. uncinata lost water 60 % faster than P. alpinum; however, clumps of S. uncinata took longer to dry than those of P. alpinum (11 vs. 5 h, respectively). In contrast, rehydration took less than 10 min for both mosses. Total non-structural carbohydrate content was higher in P. alpinum than in S. uncinata, but sugar levels changed more in P. alpinum during desiccation and rehydration (60-50 %) when compared to S. uncinata. We report the presence of galactinol (a precursor of the raffinose family) for the first time in P. alpinum. Galactinol was present at higher amounts than all other non-structural sugars. Conclusions: Individual plants of S. uncinata were not able to retain water for long periods but by growing and forming carpets, this species can retain water the longest. In contrast individual P. alpinum plants required more time to lose water than S. uncinata, but as moss cushions they suffered desiccation faster than the later. On the other hand, both species rehydrated very quickly. We found that when both mosses lost 50 % of their water, carbohydrates content remained stable and the plants did not accumulate non-structural carbohydrates during the desiccation prosses as usually occurs in vascular plants. The raffinose family oligosaccarides decreased during desiccation, and increased during rehydration, suggesting they function as osmoprotectors.},

abstract = {Several authors have argued recently that extensive taxon sampling has a positive and important effect on the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates. However, other authors have argued that there is little benefit of extensive taxon sampling, and so phylogenetic problems can or should be reduced to a few exemplar taxa as a means of reducing the computational complexity of the phylogenetic analysis. In this paper we examined five aspects of study design that may have led to these different perspectives. First, we considered the measurement of phylogenetic error across a wide range of taxon sample sizes, and conclude that the expected error based on randomly selecting trees (which varies by taxon sample size) must be considered in evaluating error in studies of the effects of taxon sampling. Second, we addressed the scope of the phylogenetic problems defined by different samples of taxa, and argue that phylogenetic scope needs to be considered in evaluating the importance of taxon-sampling strategies. Third, we examined the claim that fast and simple tree searches are as effective as more thorough searches at finding near-optimal trees that minimize error. We show that a more complete search of tree space reduces phylogenetic error, especially as the taxon sample size increases. Fourth, we examined the effects of simple versus complex simulation models on taxonomic sampling studies. Although benefits of taxon sampling are apparent for all models, data generated under more complex models of evolution produce higher overall levels of error and show greater positive effects of increased taxon sampling. Fifth, we asked if different phylogenetic optimality criteria show different effects of taxon sampling. Although we found strong differences in effectiveness of different optimality criteria as a function of taxon sample size, increased taxon sampling improved the results from all the common optimality criteria. Nonetheless, the method that showed the lowest overall performance (minimum evolution) also showed the least improvement from increased taxon sampling. Taking each of these results into account re-enforces the conclusion that increased sampling of taxa is one of the most important ways to increase overall phylogenetic accuracy.},
